The flag of England fluttered at her yard-arm, while at\nthe top of the mainmast floated a blue pennon, bearing the initials\nE. G., worked in gold and surmounted by a ducal coronet. The yacht\nwas called the Duncan, and belonged to Lord Glenarvan, one of the\nsixteen Scottish peers sitting in the House of Lords, and also a most\ndistinguished member of the \"Royal Thames Yacht Club,\" so celebrated\nthroughout the United Kingdom.\n\nLord Edward Glenarvan was on board with his young wife, Lady Helena,\nand one of his cousins, Major MacNabb. The Duncan, newly constructed,\nhad just been making a trial voyage several miles beyond the Frith of\nClyde, and was now on her return to Glasgow. Already Arran Island was\nappearing on the horizon, when the look-out signaled an enormous fish\nthat was sporting in the wake of the yacht. The captain, John Mangles,\nat once informed Lord Glenarvan of the fact, who mounted on deck with\nMajor MacNabb, and asked the captain what he thought of the animal.\n\n\"Indeed, your lordship,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"I think it is a\nshark of large proportions.\"\n\n\"A shark in these regions!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Without doubt,\" replied the captain. \"This fish belongs to a species\nof sharks that are found in all seas and latitudes. It is the\n'balance-fish,' and, if I am not greatly mistaken, we shall have an\nencounter with one of these fellows. If your lordship consents, and it\npleases Lady Helena to witness such a novel chase, we will soon see\nwhat we have to deal with.\"\n\n\"What do you think, MacNabb?\" said Lord Glenarvan to the major; \"are\nyou of a mind to try the adventure?\"\n\n\"I am of whatever opinion pleases you,\" answered the major, calmly.\n\n\"Besides,\" continued Captain Mangles, \"we cannot too soon exterminate\nthese terrible monsters. Let us improve the opportunity, and, if your\nlordship pleases, it shall be an exciting scene as well as a good\naction.\"\n\n\"Very well, captain,\" said Lord Glenarvan. He then summoned Lady\nHelena, who joined him on deck, tempted by the exciting sport.\n\nThe sea was magnificent. You could easily follow along its surface the\nrapid motions of the fish, as it plunged and rose again with surprising\nagility. Captain Mangles gave his orders, and the sailors threw over\nthe starboard ratling a stout rope, to which was fastened a hook baited\nwith a thick piece of pork.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST MOUTHFUL.]\n\nThe shark, although still at a distance of fifty yards, scented the\nbait offered to his voracity. He rapidly approached the yacht. You\ncould see his fins, gray at their extremity and black at their base,\nbeat the waves with violence, while his \"caudal appendage\" kept him\nin a rigorously straight line. As he advanced, his great glaring eyes\nseemed inflamed with eagerness, and his yawning jaws, when he turned,\ndisclosed a quadruple row of teeth. His head was large, and shaped like\na double-headed hammer. Captain Mangles was right. It was a very large\nspecimen of the most rapacious family of sharks,--the \"balance fish\" of\nthe English and the \"jew-fish\" of the Proven\u00e7als.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAll on board of the Duncan followed the movements of the shark with\nlively attention. The animal was soon within reach of the hook; he\nturned upon his back, in order to seize it better, and the enormous\nbait disappeared down his vast gullet. At the same time he hooked\nhimself, giving the line a violent shake, whereupon the sailors\nhoisted the huge creature by means of a pulley at the end of the\nyard-arm.\n\nThe shark struggled violently at feeling himself drawn from his natural\nelement, but his struggles were of no avail. A rope with a slip-noose\nconfined his tail and paralyzed his movements. A few moments afterward\nhe was hauled over the ratlings, and precipitated upon the deck of the\nyacht. One of the sailors at once approached him, not without caution,\nand with a vigorous blow of the hatchet cut off the formidable tail of\nthe animal.\n\nThe chase was ended, and there was nothing more to fear from the\nmonster. The vengeance of the sailors was satisfied, but not their\ncuriosity. Indeed, it is customary on board of every vessel to\ncarefully examine the stomachs of sharks. The men, knowing the\ninordinate voracity of the creature, wait with some anxiety, and their\nexpectation is not always in vain.\n\nLady Glenarvan, not wishing to witness this strange \"exploration,\"\nretired to the cabin. The shark was still panting. He was ten feet\nlong, and weighed more than six hundred pounds. These dimensions are\nnothing extraordinary; for if the balance-fish is not classed among the\ngiants of this species, at least he belongs to the most formidable of\ntheir family.\n\nThe enormous fish was soon cut open by a blow of the hatchet, without\nfurther ceremony. The hook had penetrated to the stomach, which was\nabsolutely empty. Evidently the animal had fasted a long time, and\nthe disappointed seamen were about to cast the remains into the sea,\nwhen the attention of the mate was attracted by a bulky object firmly\nimbedded in the viscera.\n\n\"Ha! what is this?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"That,\" replied one of the sailors, \"is a piece of rock that the\ncreature has taken in for ballast.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said another; \"it is probably a bullet that this fellow has\nreceived in the stomach, and could not digest.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring\nit into the cabin.\"]\n\n\"Be still, all of you!\" cried Tom Austin, the mate; \"do you not see\nthat the animal was a great drunkard? and to lose nothing, has drank\nnot only the wine, but the bottle too!\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Lord Glenarvan, \"is it a bottle that this shark has\nin his stomach?\"\n\n\"A real bottle!\" replied the mate, \"but you can easily see that it does\nnot come from the wine-cellar.\"\n\n\"Well, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"draw it out carefully. Bottles found in\nthe sea frequently contain precious documents.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Major MacNabb.\n\n\"I do; at least, that it may happen so.\"\n\n\"Oh! I do not contradict you,\" replied the major. \"Perhaps there may be\na secret in this.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Glenarvan. \"Well, Tom?\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the mate, displaying the shapeless object that he\nhad just drawn with difficulty from the interior of the shark.\n\n\"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring it into the\ncabin.\"", "\"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring it into the\ncabin.\"\n\nTom obeyed; and the bottle found under such singular circumstances was\nplaced on the cabin-table, around which Lord Glenarvan, Major MacNabb,\nand Captain John Mangles took their seats, together with Lady Helena;\nfor a woman, they say, is always a little inquisitive.\n\nEverything causes excitement at sea. For a moment there was silence.\nEach gazed wonderingly at this strange waif. Did it contain the secret\nof a disaster, or only an insignificant message confided to the mercy\nof the waves by some idle navigator?\n\n[Sidenote: \"OLD IN BOTTLE.\"]\n\nHowever, they must know what it was, and Glenarvan, without waiting\nlonger, proceeded to examine the bottle. He took, moreover, all\nnecessary precautions. You would have thought a coroner was pointing\nout the particulars of a suspicious quest. And Glenarvan was right,\nfor the most insignificant mark in appearance may often lead to an\nimportant discovery.\n\nBefore examining it internally, the bottle was inspected externally.\nIt had a slender neck, the mouth of which was protected by an\niron wire considerably rusted. Its sides were very thick, and\ncapable of supporting a pressure of several atmospheres, betraying\nevidently previous connection with champagne. With these bottles the\nwine-dressers of A\u00ef and Epernay block carriage-wheels without their\nshowing the slightest fracture. This one could, therefore, easily bear\nthe hardships of a long voyage.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"A bottle of the Maison Cliquot,\" said the major quietly; and, as if he\nought to know, his affirmation was accepted without contradiction.\n\n\"My dear major,\" said Lady Helena, \"it matters little what this bottle\nis, provided we know whence it comes.\"\n\n\"We shall know, my dear,\" said Lord Edward, \"and already we can affirm\nthat it has come from a distance. See the petrified particles that\ncover it, these substances mineralized, so to speak, under the action\nof the sea-water. This waif had already taken a long voyage in the\nocean, before being engulfed in the stomach of a shark.\"\n\n\"I cannot but be of your opinion,\" replied the major; \"this fragile\nvase, protected by its strong envelope, must have made a long journey.\"\n\n\"But whence does it come?\" inquired Lady Glenarvan.\n\n\"Wait, my dear Helena, wait. We must be patient with bottles. If I am\nnot greatly mistaken, this one will itself answer all our questions.\"\n\nAnd so saying, Glenarvan began to scrape off the hard particles that\nprotected the neck. Soon the cork appeared, but very much damaged with\nthe salt water.\n\n\"This is a pity,\" said Glenarvan; \"for if there is any paper in it, it\nwill be in a bad condition.\"\n\n\"That's what I fear,\" replied the major.\n\n\"I will add,\" continued Glenarvan, \"that this badly-corked bottle would\nsoon have sunk; and it is fortunate that this shark swallowed it, and\nbrought it on board of the Duncan.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" interposed Captain Mangles; \"it would have been better,\nhowever, had it been caught in the open sea on a well-known latitude\nand longitude. We could then, by studying the atmospheric and marine\ncurrents, have discovered the course traversed; but with a guide like\none of these sharks, that travel against wind and tide, we cannot know\nwhence it comes.\"\n\n\"We shall soon see,\" answered Glenarvan. At the same time he drew out\nthe cork with the greatest care, and a strong saline odor permeated the\ncabin.\n\n\"Well?\" said Lady Helena, with a truly feminine impatience.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Glenarvan; \"I am not mistaken! Here are papers!\"\n\n\"Documents! documents!\" cried Lady Helena.\n\n\"Only,\" replied Glenarvan, \"they appear to be damaged by the water.\nIt is impossible to remove them, for they adhere to the sides of the\nbottle.\"\n\n\"Let us break it,\" said MacNabb.\n\n\"I would rather keep it whole,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Illustration: The fragments soon strewed the table, and several pieces\nof paper were perceived adhering to each other. Glenarvan drew them out\ncarefully.]\n\n\"I should, too,\" said the major.\n\n\"Very true,\" added Lady Helena; \"but the contents are more valuable\nthan that which contains them, and it is better to sacrifice one than\nthe other.\"\n\n\"Let your lordship only break off the neck,\" said the captain, \"and\nthat will enable you to draw them out without injury.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, my dear Edward!\" cried Lady Glenarvan.\n\nIt was difficult to proceed in any other way, and, at all hazards,\nGlenarvan determined to break the neck of the precious bottle. It was\nnecessary to use a hammer, for the stony covering had acquired the\nhardness of granite. The fragments soon strewed the table, and several\npieces of paper were perceived adhering to each other. Glenarvan drew\nthem out carefully, separating and examining them closely, while Lady\nHelena, the major, and the captain crowded around him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE THREE DOCUMENTS.\n\n\nThese pieces of paper, half destroyed by the sea-water, exhibited only\na few words, the traces of handwriting almost entirely effaced. For\nseveral minutes Lord Glenarvan examined them attentively, turned them\nabout in every way, and exposed them to the light of day, observing\nthe least traces of writing spared by the sea. Then he looked at his\nfriends, who were regarding him with anxious eyes.\n\n\"There are here,\" said he, \"three distinct documents, probably three\ncopies of the same missive, translated into three different languages:\none English, another French, and the third German. The few words that\nremain leave no doubt on this point.\"\n\n\"But these words have at least a meaning?\" said Lady Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is difficult to say, my dear Helena. The words traced on these\npapers are very imperfect.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they will complete each other,\" said the major.\n\n\"That may be,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"It is not probable that the\nwater has obliterated these lines in exactly the same places on each,\nand by comparing these remains of phrases we shall arrive at some\nintelligible meaning.\"\n\n\"We will do so,\" said Lord Glenarvan; \"but let us proceed\nsystematically. And, first, here is the English document.\"\n\nIt showed the following arrangement of lines and words:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"That does not mean much,\" said the major, with an air of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Whatever it may mean,\" replied the captain, \"it is good English.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of that,\" said his lordship. \"The words _wreck,\naland, this, and, lost_, are perfect. _Cap_ evidently means _captain_,\nreferring to the captain of a shipwrecked vessel.\"\n\n\"Let us add,\" said the captain, \"the portions of the words _docu_ and\n_ssistance_, the meaning of which is plain.\"\n\n\"Well, something is gained already!\" added Lady Helena.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" replied the major, \"entire lines are wanting. How can\nwe find the name of the lost vessel, or the place of shipwreck?\"\n\n\"We shall find them,\" said Lord Edward.\n\n\"Very likely,\" answered the major, who was invariably of the opinion of\nevery one else; \"but how?\"\n\n\"By comparing one document with another.\"\n\n\"Let us see!\" cried Lady Helena.\n\nThe second piece of paper, more damaged than the former, exhibited only\nisolated words, arranged thus:\n\n[Sidenote: COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY.]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"This is written in German,\" said Captain Mangles, when he had cast his\neyes upon it.\n\n\"And do you know that language?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Perfectly, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Well, tell us what these few words mean.\"\n\nThe captain examined the document closely, and expressed himself as\nfollows:\n\n\"First, the date of the event is determined. _7 Juni_ means June 7th,\nand by comparing this figure with the figures '62,' furnished by the\nEnglish document, we have the date complete,--June 7th, 1862.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" exclaimed Lady Helena. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"On the same line,\" continued the young captain, \"I find the word\n_Glas_, which, united with the word _gow_ of the first document, gives\n_Glasgow_. It is plainly a ship from the port of Glasgow.\"\n\n\"That was my opinion,\" said the major.\n\n\"The second line is missing entirely,\" continued Captain Mangles; \"but\non the third I meet with two important words _zwei_, which means _two_,\nand _atrosen_, or rather _matrosen_, which signifies _sailors_ in\nGerman.\"\n\n\"There were a captain and two sailors, then?\" said Lady Helena.\n\n\"Probably,\" replied her husband.\n\n\"I will confess, your lordship,\" said the captain, \"that the next word,\n_graus_, puzzles me. I do not know how to translate it. Perhaps the\nthird document will enable us to understand it. As to the two last\nwords, they are easily explained. _Bringt ihnen_ means _bring to them_,\nand if we compare these with the English word, which is likewise on the\nsixth line of the first document (I mean the word _assistance_), we\nshall have the phrase _bring them assistance_.\"\n\n\"Yes, bring them assistance,\" said Glenarvan. \"But where are the\nunfortunates? We have not yet a single indication of the place, and the\nscene of the catastrophe is absolutely unknown.\"\n\n\"Let us hope that the French document will be more explicit,\" said Lady\nHelena.\n\n\"Let us look at it, then,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and, as we all know this\nlanguage, our examination will be more easy.\"\n\nHere is an exact fac-simile of the third document:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"There are figures!\" cried Lady Helena. \"Look, gentlemen, look!\"\n\n\"Let us proceed in order,\" said Lord Glenarvan, \"and start at\nthe beginning. Permit me to point out one by one these scattered\nand incomplete words. I see from the first letters _troi_ _ats_\n(_trois-mats_), that it is a brig, the name of which, thanks to the\nEnglish and French documents, is entirely preserved: _The Britannia_.\nOf the two following words, _gonie_ and _austral_, only the last has an\nintelligible meaning.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE PUZZLE EXPLAINED.]\n\n\"That is an important point,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"the shipwreck\ntook place in the southern hemisphere.\"\n\n\"That is indefinite,\" said the major.", "[Sidenote: THE PUZZLE EXPLAINED.]\n\n\"That is an important point,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"the shipwreck\ntook place in the southern hemisphere.\"\n\n\"That is indefinite,\" said the major.\n\n\"I will continue,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"The word _abor_ is the trace of\nthe verb _aborder_ (to land). These unfortunates have landed somewhere.\nBut where? _Contin!_ Is it on a continent? _Cruel!_\"\n\n\"'Cruel!'\" cried Mangles; \"that explains the German word _graus,\ngrausam, cruel_!\"\n\n\"Go on, go on!\" cried Glenarvan, whose interest was greatly excited as\nthe meaning of these incomplete words was elucidated. \"_Indi_! Is it\nIndia, then, where these sailors have been cast? What is the meaning of\nthe word _ongit_? Ha, longitude! And here is the latitude, 37\u00b0 11'. In\nshort, we have a definite indication.\"\n\n\"But the longitude is wanting,\" said MacNabb.\n\n\"We cannot have everything, my dear major,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and\nan exact degree of latitude is something. This French document is\ndecidedly the most complete of the three. Each of them was evidently\na literal translation of the others, for they all convey the same\ninformation. We must, therefore, unite and translate them into one\nlanguage, and seek their most probable meaning, the one that is most\nlogical and explicit.\"\n\n\"Shall we make this translation in French, English, or German?\" asked\nthe major.\n\n\"In English,\" answered Glenarvan, \"since that is our own language.\"\n\n\"Your lordship is right,\" said Captain Mangles, \"besides, it was also\ntheirs.\"\n\n\"It is agreed, then. I will write this document, uniting these parts of\nwords and fragments of phrases, leaving the gaps that separate them,\nand filling up those the meaning of which is not ambiguous. Then we\nwill compare them and form an opinion.\"\n\nGlenarvan at once took a pen, and, in a few moments, presented to his\nfriends a paper on which were written the following lines:\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt this moment a sailor informed the captain that the Duncan was\nentering the Frith of Clyde, and asked his orders.\n\n\"What are your lordship's wishes?\" said the captain, addressing Lord\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"Reach Dumbarton as quickly as possible, captain. Then, while Lady\nHelena returns to Malcolm Castle, I will go to London and submit this\ndocument to the authorities.\"\n\nThe captain gave his orders in pursuance of this, and the mate executed\nthem.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"we will continue our\ninvestigations. We are on the track of a great catastrophe. The lives\nof several men depend upon our sagacity. Let us use therefore all our\ningenuity to divine the secret of this enigma.\"\n\n\"We are ready, my dear Edward,\" replied Lady Helena.\n\n\"First of all,\" continued Glenarvan, \"we must consider three distinct\npoints in this document. First, what is known; second, what can be\nconjectured; and third, what is unknown. What do we know? That on the\n7th of June, 1862, a brig, the Britannia, of Glasgow, was wrecked;\nthat two sailors and the captain threw this document into the sea in\nlatitude 37\u00b0 11', and in it ask for assistance.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied the major.\n\n[Sidenote: \"LINE UPON LINE.\"]\n\n\"What can we conjecture?\" resumed Glenarvan. \"First, that the\nshipwreck took place in the South Seas; and now I call your attention\nto the word _gonia_. Does it not indicate the name of the country which\nthey reached?\"\n\n\"Patagonia!\" cried Lady Helena.\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"But is Patagonia crossed by the thirty-seventh parallel?\" asked the\nmajor.\n\n\"That is easily seen,\" said the captain, taking out a map of South\nAmerica. \"It is so: Patagonia is bisected by the thirty-seventh\nparallel, which crosses Araucania, over the Pampas, north of Patagonia,\nand is lost in the Atlantic.\"\n\n\"Well, let us continue our conjectures. The two sailors and the captain\n_abor, land_. Where? _Contin_,--the _continent_, you understand; a\ncontinent, not an island. What becomes of them? We have fortunately\ntwo letters, _pr_, which inform us of their fate. These unfortunates,\nin short, are _captured_ (pris) or _prisoners_. By whom? The _cruel\nIndians_. Are you convinced? Do not the words fit naturally into the\nvacant places? Does not the document grow clear to your eyes? Does not\nlight break in upon your mind?\"\n\nGlenarvan spoke with conviction. His looks betokened an absolute\nconfidence; and his enthusiasm was communicated to his hearers. Like\nhim they cried, \"It is plain! it is plain!\"\n\nA moment after Lord Edward resumed, in these terms:\n\n\"All these hypotheses, my friends, seem to me extremely plausible. In\nmy opinion, the catastrophe took place on the shores of Patagonia.\nHowever, I will inquire at Glasgow what was the destination of the\nBritannia, and we shall know whether she could have been led to these\nregions.\"\n\n\"We do not need to go so far,\" replied the captain; \"I have here the\nshipping news of the _Mercantile and Shipping Gazette_, which will give\nus definite information.\"\n\n\"Let us see! let us see!\" said Lady Glenarvan.\n\nCaptain Mangles took a file of papers of the year 1862, and began to\nturn over the leaves rapidly. His search was soon ended; as he said, in\na tone of satisfaction,--\n\n\"May 30, 1862, Callao, Peru, _Britannia_, Captain Grant, bound for\nGlasgow.\"\n\n\"Grant!\" exclaimed Lord Glenarvan; \"that hardy Scotchman who wished to\nfound a new Scotland in the waters of the Pacific?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the captain, \"the very same, who, in 1861, embarked in\nthe Britannia at Glasgow, and of whom nothing has since been heard.\"\n\n\"Exactly! exactly!\" said Glenarvan; \"it is indeed he. The Britannia\nleft Callao the 30th of May, and on the 7th of June, eight days after\nher departure, she was lost on the shores of Patagonia. This is the\nwhole story elucidated from the remains of these words that seemed\nundecipherable. You see, my friends, that what we can conjecture is\nvery important. As to what we do not know, this is reduced to one item,\nthe missing degree of longitude.\"\n\n\"It is of no account,\" added Captain Mangles, \"since the country is\nknown; and with the latitude alone, I will undertake to go straight to\nthe scene of the shipwreck.\"\n\n\"We know all, then?\" said Lady Glenarvan.\n\n\"All, my dear Helena: and these blanks that the sea has made between\nthe words of the document, I can as easily fill out as though I were\nwriting at the dictation of Captain Grant.\"\n\nAccordingly Lord Glenarvan took the pen again, and wrote, without\nhesitation, the following note:\n\n\"June 7, 1862.--The brig Britannia of Glasgow was wrecked on the shores\nof Patagonia, in the Southern Hemisphere. Directing their course to\nland, two sailors and Captain Grant attempted to reach the continent,\nwhere they will be prisoners of the cruel Indians. They have thrown\nthis document into the sea, at longitude ----, latitude 37\u00b0 11'. Bring\nthem assistance or they are lost.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A NOBLE RESOLVE.]\n\n\"Good! good! my dear Edward!\" said Lady Glenarvan; \"and if these\nunfortunates see their native country again, they will owe this\nhappiness to you.\"\n\n\"And they shall see it again,\" replied Glenarvan. \"This document is too\nexplicit, too clear, too certain, for Englishmen to hesitate. What has\nbeen done for Sir John Franklin, and so many others, will also be done\nfor the shipwrecked of the Britannia.\"\n\n\"But these unfortunates,\" answered Lady Helena, \"have, without doubt,\na family that mourns their loss. Perhaps this poor Captain Grant has a\nwife, children----\"\n\n[Illustration: Dumbarton Castle.]\n\n\"You are right, my dear lady; and I charge myself with informing them\nthat all hope is not yet lost. And now, my friends, let us go on deck,\nfor we must be approaching the harbor.\"\n\nIndeed, the Duncan had forced on steam, and was now skirting the shores\nof Bute Island. Rothesay, with its charming little village nestling in\nits fertile valley, was left on the starboard, and the vessel entered\nthe narrow inlets of the frith, passed Greenock, and, at six in the\nevening, was anchored at the foot of the basaltic rocks of Dumbarton,\ncrowned by the celebrated castle.\n\nHere a coach was waiting to take Lady Helena and Major MacNabb back to\nMalcolm Castle. Lord Glenarvan, after embracing his young wife, hurried\nto take the express train for Glasgow. But before going, he confided an\nimportant message to a more rapid agent, and a few moments after the\nelectric telegraph conveyed to the _Times_ and _Morning Chronicle_ an\nadvertisement in the following terms:\n\n\"For any information concerning the brig Britannia of Glasgow, Captain\nGrant, address Lord Glenarvan, Malcolm Castle, Luss, County of\nDumbarton, Scotland.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN'S CHILDREN.\n\n\n[Sidenote: THE GLENARVAN ANCESTRY.]\n\nThe castle of Malcolm, one of the most romantic in Scotland, is\nsituated near the village of Luss, whose pretty valley it crowns. The\nlimpid waters of Loch Lomond bathe the granite of its walls. From time\nimmemorial it has belonged to the Glenarvan family, who have preserved\nin the country of Rob Roy and Fergus MacGregor the hospitable customs\nof the ancient heroes of Walter Scott. At the epoch of the social\nrevolution in Scotland, a great number of vassals were expelled,\nbecause they could not pay the great rents to the ancient chiefs\nof the clans. Some died of hunger, others became fishermen, others\nemigrated. There was general despair.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAmong all these the Glenarvans alone believed that fidelity bound the\nhigh as well as the low, and they remained faithful to their tenants.\nNot one left the roof under which he was born; not one abandoned the\nsoil where his ancestors reposed; all continued in the clan of their\nancient lords. Thus at this epoch, in this age of disaffection and\ndisunion, the Glenarvan family considered the Scots at Malcolm Castle\nas their own people. All were descended from the vassals of their\nkinsmen; were children of the counties of Stirling and Dumbarton, and\nhonestly devoted, body and estate, to their master.", "Lord Glenarvan possessed an immense fortune, which he employed in\ndoing much good. His kindness exceeded even his generosity, for one\nwas boundless, while the other was necessarily limited. The lord of\nLuss, the \"laird\" of Malcolm, represented his fellows in the House of\nLords; but with true Scottish ideas, little pleasing to the southrons,\nhe was disliked by many of them especially because he adhered to the\ntraditions of his ancestors, and energetically opposed some dicta of\nmodern political economy.\n\nHe was not, however, a backward man, either in wit or shrewdness; but\nwhile ready to enter every door of progress, he remained Scotch at\nheart, and it was for the glory of his native land that he contended\nwith his racing yachts in the matches of the Royal Thames Yacht Club.\n\nLord Edward Glenarvan was thirty-two years old. His form was erect and\nhis features sharp, but his look was mild, and his character thoroughly\nimbued with the poetry of the Highlands. He was known to be brave to\nexcess, enterprising, chivalrous, a Fergus of the nineteenth century;\nbut good above all, better than Saint Martin himself, for he would have\ngiven his very cloak to the poor people of the Highlands.\n\nHe had been married scarcely three months, having espoused Miss Helena\nTuffnel, daughter of the great traveler, William Tuffnel, one of the\nnumerous victims to the great passion for geographical discoveries.\n\nMiss Helena did not belong to a noble family, but she was Scotch, which\nequaled all nobilities in the eyes of Lord Glenarvan. This charming\nyoung creature, high-minded and devoted, the lord of Luss had made the\ncompanion of his life. He found her one day living alone, an orphan,\nalmost without fortune, in the house of her father at Kilpatrick. He\nsaw that the poor girl would make a noble wife, and he married her.\n\nMiss Tuffnel was twenty-two, a youthful blonde, with eyes as blue as\nthe waters of the Scotch lakes on a beautiful morning in spring. Her\nlove for her husband exceeded even her gratitude. She loved him as if\nshe had been the rich heiress, and he the friendless orphan. As to\ntheir tenants and servants, they were ready to lay down their lives for\nher whom they called \"our good lady of Luss.\"\n\n[Sidenote: LIFE IN THE SCOTTISH HOME.]\n\nLord and Lady Glenarvan lived happily at Malcolm Castle, in the midst\nof the grand and wild scenery of the Highlands, rambling in the\nshady alleys of horse-chestnuts and sycamores, along the shores of\nthe lake, where still resounded the war cries of ancient times, or\nin the depths of those uncultivated gorges in which the history of\nScotland lies written in ruins from age to age. One day they would\nwander in the forests of beeches and larches, and in the midst of the\nmasses of heather; another, they would scale the precipitous summits\nof Ben Lomond, or traverse on horseback the solitary glens, studying,\ncomprehending, and admiring this poetic country, still called \"the land\nof Rob Roy,\" and all those celebrated sites so grandly sung by Walter\nScott.\n\nIn the sweet, still evening, when the \"lantern of Mac Farlane\"\nillumined the horizon, they would stroll along the \"bartizans,\" an old\ncircular balcony that formed a chain of battlements to Malcolm Castle,\nand there, pensive, oblivious, and as if alone in the world, seated\non some detached rock, under the pale rays of the moon, while night\ngradually enveloped the rugged summits of the mountains, they would\ncontinue wrapt in that pure ecstasy and inward delight known only to\nloving hearts.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThus passed the first months of their married life. But Lord Glenarvan\ndid not forget that his wife was the daughter of a great traveler. He\nthought that Lady Helena must have in her heart all the aspirations of\nher father, and he was not mistaken. The Duncan was constructed, and\nwas designed to convey Lord and Lady Glenarvan to the most beautiful\ncountries of the world, along the waves of the Mediterranean, and to\nthe isles of the Archipelago. Imagine the joy of Lady Helena when her\nhusband placed the Duncan at her disposal! Indeed, can there be a\ngreater happiness than to lead your love towards those charming \"isles\nwhere Sappho sung,\" and behold the enchanting scenes of the Orient,\nwith all their spirit-stirring memories?\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMeantime Lord Glenarvan had started for London. The safety of the\nunfortunate shipwrecked men was at stake. Thus, in his temporary\nabsence, Lady Helena showed herself more anxious than sad. The next\nday a dispatch from her husband made her hope for a speedy return; in\nthe evening a letter hinted at its postponement. His proposal had to\nencounter some difficulties, and the following day a second letter\ncame, in which Lord Glenarvan did not conceal his indignation against\nthe authorities.\n\n[Illustration: \"Please, madam, speak! I am strong against grief, and\ncan hear all.\"]\n\nOn that day Lady Helena began to be uneasy. At evening she was alone in\nher chamber, when the steward of the castle, Mr. Halbert, came to ask\nif she would see a young girl and boy who desired to speak with Lord\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"People of the country?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"No, madam,\" replied the steward, \"for I do not know them. They have\njust arrived by the Balloch railway, and from Balloch to Luss they tell\nme they have made the journey on foot.\"\n\n\"Bid them come up, steward,\" said Lady Glenarvan.\n\nThe steward withdrew. Some moments afterward the young girl and boy\nwere ushered into Lady Helena's chamber. They were brother and sister;\nyou could not doubt it by their resemblance.\n\nThe sister was sixteen. Her pretty face showed weariness, her eyes must\nhave shed many tears; her resigned, but courageous, countenance, and\nher humble, but neat, attire, all prepossessed one in her favor. She\nheld by the hand a boy of twelve years, of determined look, who seemed\nto take his sister under his protection. Indeed, whoever had insulted\nthe young girl would have had to settle with this little gentleman.\n\nThe sister stopped, a little surprised at seeing herself before Lady\nHelena; but the latter hastened to open the conversation.\n\n\"You wish to speak with me?\" said she, with an encouraging look at the\nyoung girl.\n\n[Sidenote: \"ONE TOUCH OF NATURE.\"]\n\n\"No,\" answered the boy, in a decided tone; \"not with you, but with Lord\nGlenarvan himself.\"\n\n\"Excuse him, madam,\" said the sister, looking at her brother.\n\n\"Lord Glenarvan is not at the castle,\" replied Lady Helena; \"but I am\nhis wife, and if I can supply his place with you----\"\n\n\"You are Lady Glenarvan?\" said the young girl.\n\n\"Yes, miss.\"\n\n\"The wife of Lord Glenarvan, of Malcolm Castle, who published an\nadvertisement in the _Times_ in regard to the shipwreck of the\nBritannia?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" answered Lady Helena, with alacrity. \"And you?\"\n\n\"I am Miss Grant, and this is my brother.\"\n\n\"Miss Grant! Miss Grant!\" cried Lady Helena, drawing the young girl\ntowards her, and taking her hands, while she also drew the boy towards\nher.\n\n\"Madam,\" replied the young girl, \"what do you know of the shipwreck of\nmy father? Is he living? Shall we ever see him again? Speak! oh, please\ntell me!\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" said Lady Helena, \"God forbid that I should answer you\nlightly on such a subject; I would not give you a vain hope----\"\n\n\"Please, madam, speak! I am strong against grief, and can hear all.\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" answered Lady Helena, \"the hope is very slight, but\nwith the help of God who can do everything, it is possible that you\nwill one day see your father again.\"\n\n\"Alas, alas!\" exclaimed Miss Grant, who could not restrain her tears,\nwhile Robert covered the hands of Lady Glenarvan with kisses.\n\nWhen the first paroxysm of this mournful joy was past, the young girl\nbegan to ask innumerable questions. Lady Helena related the story of\nthe document, how that the Britannia had been lost on the shores\nof Patagonia; in what way, after the shipwreck, the captain and two\nsailors, the only survivors, must have reached the continent; and,\nat last, how they implored the assistance of the whole world in this\ndocument, written in three languages, and abandoned to the caprices of\nthe ocean.\n\nDuring this recital Robert Grant devoured Lady Helena with his eyes;\nhis life seemed to hang on her lips. In his childish imagination he\nreviewed the terrible scenes of which his father must have been the\nvictim. He saw him on the deck of the Britannia; he followed him to the\nbosom of the waves; he clung with him to the rocks of the shore; he\ndragged himself panting along the beach, out of reach of the waves.\n\nOften during the course of this narration words escaped his lips.\n\n\"Oh, papa! my poor papa!\" he cried, pressing close to his sister.\n\nAs for Miss Grant, she listened with clasped hands, and did not utter a\nword until the story was ended, when she said,--\n\n\"Oh, madam, the document! the document!\"\n\n\"I no longer have it, my dear child,\" replied Lady Helena.\n\n\"You no longer have it?\"\n\n\"No; for the very sake of your father, Lord Glenarvan had to take it\nto London; but I have told you all it contained, word for word, and\nhow we succeeded in discovering the exact meaning. Among these remains\nof the almost effaced words the water had spared some characters.\nUnfortunately the record of the longitude had altogether been\ndestroyed, but that was the only missing point. Thus you see, Miss\nGrant, the minutest details of this document are known to you as well\nas me.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the young girl; \"but I would like to have seen my\nfather's writing.\"\n\n[Sidenote: WAITING FOR THE VERDICT.]\n\n\"Well, to-morrow, perhaps, Lord Glenarvan will return. My husband\ndesired to submit this indisputable document to the authorities in\nLondon, to induce them to send a vessel immediately in search of\nCaptain Grant.\"\n\n\"Is it possible, madam!\" cried the young girl. \"Did you do this for us?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear miss, and I expect Lord Glenarvan every moment.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" said the young girl, in a deep tone of gratitude, and with\nfervency, \"may Heaven bless Lord Glenarvan and you!\"", "\"Yes, my dear miss, and I expect Lord Glenarvan every moment.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" said the young girl, in a deep tone of gratitude, and with\nfervency, \"may Heaven bless Lord Glenarvan and you!\"\n\n\"Dear child,\" answered Lady Helena, \"we deserve no thanks. Any other\nperson in our place would have done the same. May the hopes that are\nkindled be realized! Till Lord Glenarvan's return you will remain at\nthe castle.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" said the young girl, \"I would not presume on the sympathy you\nshow to us strangers----\"\n\n\"Strangers! Dear child, neither your brother nor you are strangers in\nthis house; and I desire that Lord Glenarvan on his arrival should\ninform the children of Captain Grant of what is to be attempted to save\ntheir father.\"\n\nIt was not possible to refuse an invitation made with so much\ncordiality. It was, therefore, decided that Miss Grant and her brother\nshould await at Malcolm Castle the return of Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nLADY GLENARVAN'S PROPOSAL.\n\n\nDuring this conversation, Lady Helena had not spoken of the fears\nexpressed in her husband's letters concerning the reception of his\npetition by the London officials; nor was a word said in regard to the\nprobable captivity of Captain Grant among the Indians of South America.\nWhy afflict these poor children with their father's situation, and\ncheck the hopes they had just conceived? It would not change matters.\nLady Helena was, therefore, silent on this point, and, after satisfying\nall Miss Grant's inquiries, she questioned her concerning her life, and\nsituation in the world in which she seemed to be the sole protectress\nof her brother. It was a simple and touching story, which still more\nincreased Lady Glenarvan's sympathy for the young girl.\n\nMary and Robert Grant were the only children of Captain Harry Grant,\nwhose wife had died at the birth of Robert, and during his long\nvoyages his children were left to the care of his good old cousin.\nCaptain Grant was a hardy sailor, a man well acquainted with his\nprofession, and a good negotiator, combining thus a twofold aptitude\nfor his calling commercially. His home was at Dundee, in the county of\nForfar, and he was moreover, by birth, a child of that \"bonnie\" place.\nHis father, a minister of Saint Catherine's Church, had given him a\nthorough education, knowing that it would be sure to help all, even a\nsea-captain.\n\n[Sidenote: IDEAS AND REALITIES.]\n\nDuring his early voyages, first as mate, and afterwards in the\ncapacity of skipper, Harry Grant prospered, and some years after\nthe birth of his son Robert, he found himself the possessor of a\nconsiderable fortune.\n\nThen a great idea entered his mind which made his name popular\nthroughout Scotland. Like the Glenarvans and several other great\nfamilies of the Highlands, he was opposed in heart, if not in deed,\nto the advance and prevalence of English thought and feeling. The\ninterests of his country could not be in his eyes the same as those\nof the Anglo-Saxons, and, in order to give the former a peculiar and\nnational development, he resolved to found a Scottish colony in some\npart of the Southern World. Did he dream of that independence in the\nfuture of which the United States had set the example, and which the\nIndies and Australia cannot fail one day to acquire? Very likely;\nbut he allowed his secret hopes to be divined. It was, therefore,\nknown that the Government refused to lend their aid in his project\nof colonization; nay, they even raised obstacles which in any other\ncountry would have overcome the project.\n\nBut Harry Grant would not be discouraged. He appealed to the patriotism\nof his countrymen, gave his fortune to serve the cause, built a vessel\nand furnished it with a fine crew, confided his children to the care\nof his old cousin, and set sail to explore the great islands of the\nPacific.\n\nIt was the year 1861. Until May, 1862, they had received news of him,\nbut since his departure from Callao, in the month of June, no one had\nheard anything of the Britannia, and the marine intelligencers became\nsilent concerning the fate of the captain.\n\nAt this juncture of affairs the old cousin of Harry Grant died, and\nthe two children were left alone in the world. Mary Grant was then\nfourteen. Her courageous soul did not flinch at the situation that was\npresented, but she devoted herself entirely to her brother, who was\nstill a child. She must bring him up and instruct him. By dint of\neconomy, prudence, and sagacity, laboring night and day, sacrificing\nall for him, denying herself everything, the sister succeeded in\neducating her brother and bravely fulfilled her sisterly duties.\n\nThe two children lived thus at Dundee, and valiantly overcame\ntheir sorrowful and lonely circumstances. Mary thought only of her\nbrother, and dreamed of a happy future for him. As for herself, alas!\nthe Britannia was lost forever, and her father dead! We must not,\ntherefore, attempt to depict her emotion when the advertisement in the\n_Times_ accidentally met her eye, and suddenly raised her from her\ndespair.\n\nIt was no time to hesitate. Her resolution was immediately taken. Even\nif she should learn that her father's dead body had been found on a\ndesert coast, or in the hull of a shipwrecked vessel, it was better\nthan this continual doubt, this eternal torment of uncertainty. She\ntold her brother all; and the same day the two children took the Perth\nRailroad, and at evening arrived at Malcolm Castle, where Mary, after\nso many harassing thoughts, began to hope.\n\nSuch was the sorrowful story that the young girl related to Lady\nGlenarvan, in an artless manner, without thinking that through all\nthose long years of trial she had behaved herself like an heroic\ndaughter. But Lady Helena thought of this, and several times, without\nhiding her tears, she clasped in her arms the two children of Captain\nGrant.\n\nAs for Robert, it seemed as if he heard this story for the first time:\nfor he opened his eyes in astonishment, as he listened to his sister;\ncomprehended what she had done, what she had suffered; and at last,\nencircling her with his arms, he exclaimed, unable longer to restrain\nthe cry that came from the very depths of his heart,--\n\n\"Oh, mamma! my dear mamma!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"My father, my poor father!\" cried Mary Grant, throwing\nherself at the feet of Lord Glenarvan.]\n\nNight had now fully set in; and Lady Helena, remembering the fatigue of\nthe two children, would not longer continue the conversation. Mary\nand Robert were conducted to their chambers, and fell asleep dreaming\nof a brighter future.\n\n\n\nAfter they had retired, Lady Helena saw the major, and told him all the\nevents of the day.\n\n\"That Mary Grant is a brave girl,\" said MacNabb, when he had heard his\ncousin's story.\n\n\"May Heaven grant my husband success in his enterprise!\" replied Lady\nHelena; \"for the situation of the two children would be terrible!\"\n\n\"He will succeed,\" answered MacNabb, \"or the hearts of the authorities\nmust be harder than the stone of Portland.\"\n\nIn spite of the major's assurance, Lady Helena passed the night in the\ngreatest anxiety, and could scarce gain an hour's repose.\n\n[Sidenote: \"BROKEN CISTERNS.\"]\n\nThe next morning Mary and her brother rose at daybreak, and were\nwalking in the galleries and water terraces of the castle, when the\nsound of a coach was heard in the great court-yard. It was Lord\nGlenarvan returning to Malcolm Castle at the full speed of his horses.\nAlmost immediately Lady Helena, accompanied by the major, appeared\nin the court-yard, and flew to meet her husband. But he seemed sad,\ndisappointed, and angry. He clasped his wife in his arms, and was\nsilent.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Well, Edward!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Well, my dear Helena,\" he replied, \"those people have no hearts!\"\n\n\"They refused?\"\n\n\"Yes, they refused me a vessel: they spoke of the millions vainly spent\nin searching for Franklin; they declared the document was vague and\nunintelligible; they said that the shipwreck of these unfortunates had\nhappened two years ago, and that there was little chance of finding\nthem. They maintained too, that, if prisoners of the Indians, they must\nhave been carried into the interior of the country; that they could not\nransack all Patagonia to find three men,--three Scotchmen; the search\nwould be vain and perilous, and would cost the lives of more men than\nit would save. In short, they gave all the absurd reasons of people who\nmean to refuse. They remembered the captain's projects, and I fear that\nthe unfortunate man is forever lost!\"\n\n\"My father, my poor father!\" cried Mary Grant, throwing herself at the\nfeet of Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\"Your father! What, Miss----?\" said he, surprised at seeing a young\ngirl at his feet.\n\n\"Yes, Edward, Miss Grant and her brother,\" replied Lady Helena; \"the\ntwo children of Captain Grant, who have thus been condemned to remain\norphans.\"\n\n\"Ah, miss!\" answered Lord Glenarvan, \"if I had known of your\npresence----\"\n\nHe said no more. A painful silence, interrupted only by sobs, reigned\nin the court-yard. No one raised his voice, neither Lord Glenarvan,\nLady Helena, the major, nor the servants of the castle, who were\nstanding about even at this early hour. But by their attitude they all\nprotested against the conduct of the officials.\n\nAfter several moments the major resumed the conversation, and,\naddressing Lord Glenarvan, said,--\n\n\"Then you have no more hope?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Well,\" cried young Robert, \"I will go to these people, and--we shall\nsee----\"\n\nHe did not finish his threat, for his sister stopped him; but his\nclinched hands indicated his intentions.\n\n\"No, Robert,\" said she, \"no; let us thank these kind people for what\nthey have done for us. Let us always keep them in remembrance; but now\nwe must take our departure.\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried Lady Helena.\n\n\"Miss, where would you go?\" said Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\"I am going to throw myself at the feet of the Queen,\" replied the\nyoung girl, \"and we shall see if she will be deaf to the prayers of two\nchildren imploring help for their father.\"", "\"I am going to throw myself at the feet of the Queen,\" replied the\nyoung girl, \"and we shall see if she will be deaf to the prayers of two\nchildren imploring help for their father.\"\n\nLord Glenarvan shook his head; not that he doubted the clemency of Her\nGracious Majesty, but he doubted whether Mary Grant would gain access\nto her; for but few suppliants reach the steps of a throne.\n\nLady Helena understood her husband's thoughts. She knew that the young\ngirl might make a fruitless journey, and she pictured to herself these\ntwo children leading henceforth a cheerless existence. Then it was that\nshe conceived a grand and noble idea.\n\n\"Mary Grant,\" she exclaimed, \"wait, my child; listen to what I am about\nto say.\"\n\nThe young girl held her brother by the hand, and was preparing to go.\nShe stopped.\n\nThen Lady Helena, with tearful eye, but firm voice and animated\nfeatures, advanced towards her husband.\n\n[Sidenote: \"NOBLY PLANNED.\"]\n\n\"Edward,\" said she, \"when Captain Grant wrote that letter, and cast\nit into the sea, he confided it to the care of God himself, who has\nbrought it to us. Without doubt He designed to charge us with the\nsafety of these unfortunates.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Helena?\" inquired Lord Glenarvan, whilst all waited\nin silence.\n\n\"I mean,\" replied Lady Helena, \"that we ought to consider ourselves\nhappy in beginning our married life with a good action. You, my dear\nEdward, to please me, have planned a pleasure voyage. But what pleasure\ncan be more genuine or more beneficent than to save these unfortunates\nwhom hope has almost abandoned?\"\n\n\"Helena!\" cried Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, you understand me, Edward. The Duncan is a good, staunch vessel.\nIt can brave the Southern seas; it can make the tour of the world,--and\nit will, if necessary! Let us start, Edward,--let us go in search of\nCaptain Grant!\"\n\nAt these courageous words Lord Glenarvan had extended his arms to his\nwife. He smiled. He pressed her to his heart, while Mary and Robert\nkissed her hands.\n\nAnd during this touching scene the servants of the castle, affected and\nenthusiastic, uttered from their hearts this cry of gratitude,--\n\n\"Hurrah for the lady of Luss! Hurrah! three times hurrah, for Lord and\nLady Glenarvan!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHE DEPARTURE OF THE DUNCAN.\n\n\nIt has been already said that Lady Helena had a brave and generous\nsoul. What she had just done was an undeniable proof of it, and Lord\nGlenarvan had good reason to trust in this noble woman, who was\ncapable of comprehending and following him. The idea of sailing to\nthe rescue of Captain Grant had already taken possession of him when\nhe saw his petition rejected at London; but he could not have thought\nof separating from her. Yet, since she desired to go herself, all\nhesitation was at an end. The servants of the castle had received her\nproposal with cries of joy; the safety of their brother Scots was at\nstake, and Lord Glenarvan joined heartily in the hurrahs that greeted\nthe lady of Luss.\n\nThe scheme once resolved upon, there was not an hour to lose. That\nvery day Lord Glenarvan sent to Captain Mangles orders to bring the\nDuncan to Glasgow, and make every preparation for a voyage to the South\nSeas, which might become one of circumnavigation. Moreover, in her\nplans Lady Helena had not overestimated the qualities of the Duncan:\nof first-class construction with regard to strength and swiftness, she\ncould without injury sustain a long voyage.\n\n[Sidenote: FITTING FOR SEA.]\n\nThe Duncan was a steam yacht of one hundred and ten tons burden.\nShe had two masts,--a foremast with fore-sail, main-sail, foretop\nand foretop-gallant sails; and a mainmast, carrying a main-sail and\nfore-staff. Her rigging was, therefore, sufficient, and she could\nprofit by the wind like a simple clipper; but she relied especially\nupon her mechanical power. Her engine was of an effective force of one\nhundred and sixty horse power, and was constructed on a new plan. It\npossessed apparatus for overheating, which gave its steam a very great\ntension. It was a high-pressure engine, and produced motion by a double\nscrew. The Duncan under full steam could acquire a speed equal to any\nvessel of that day. Indeed, during her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, she had made, according to the log, seventeen knots an hour. She\nwas, therefore, fully capable of circumnavigating the world; and her\ncaptain had only to occupy himself with the internal arrangement.\n\nHis first care was to increase his store-room, and take in the\ngreatest possible quantity of coal, for it would be difficult to renew\ntheir supplies on the voyage. The same precaution was taken with the\nsteward's room, and provisions for two years were stowed away. Money,\nof course, was not wanting, and a pivot-gun was furnished, which was\nfixed at the forecastle. You do not know what may happen, and it is\nalways best to have the means of defense in your reach.\n\nCaptain Mangles, we must say, understood his business. Although he\ncommanded only a pleasure yacht, he was ranked among the ablest of\nthe Glasgow captains. He was thirty years of age, with rather rough\nfeatures, indicating courage and kindness. When a child, the Glenarvan\nfamily had taken him under their care, and made him an excellent\nseaman. He had often given proofs of skill, energy, and coolness during\nhis long voyages, and when Lord Glenarvan offered him the command of\nthe Duncan, he accepted it with pride and pleasure, for he loved the\nlord of Malcolm Castle as a brother, and until then had vainly sought\nan opportunity to devote himself to his service.\n\nThe mate, Tom Austin, was an old sailor worthy of all confidence; and\nthe crew of the Duncan was composed of twenty-five men, including\nthe captain and mate. They all belonged to the county of Dumbarton,\nwere all tried seamen, sons of the tenants of the family, and formed\non shipboard a genuine clan of honest people, who of course were not\nwithout the national bagpipe. Lord Glenarvan had, in them, a band of\nfaithful subjects, happy in their avocation, devoted, courageous, and\nskillful in the use of arms, as well as in the management of a ship,\nwhile they were ready to follow him on the most perilous expeditions.\nWhen they learned where they were going, they could not restrain their\njoyous emotion, and the echoes of the rocks of Dumbarton awoke to their\ncries of enthusiasm.\n\nCaptain Mangles, while occupied in lading and provisioning his craft,\ndid not forget to prepare Lord and Lady Glenarvan's apartments for a\nlong voyage. He likewise provided cabins for Captain Grant's children,\nfor Lady Helena could not refuse Mary permission to accompany her on\nthe expedition.\n\nAs for young Robert, he would have hidden in the hold sooner than\nnot go; even if he had been compelled to serve as cabin-boy, like\nLord Nelson and Sir John Franklin, he would have embarked on board\nthe Duncan. To think of opposing such a little gentleman! It was\nnot attempted. They were even obliged to take him other than as\npassenger, for as cabin-boy or sailor he _would serve_. The captain was\naccordingly commissioned to teach him the duties of a seaman.\n\n\"Good!\" said Robert; \"and let him not spare a few blows of the rope's\nend if I do not walk straight.\"\n\n\"Be easy, my boy,\" replied Glenarvan, without adding that the use of\nthe \"cat-o'-nine-tails\" was prohibited, and moreover quite needless, on\nboard the Duncan.\n\n[Sidenote: GLASGOW GOSSIP.]\n\nTo complete the roll of the passengers, it will be sufficient to\ndescribe Major MacNabb. The major was a man of fifty, of calm,\nregular features, who did as he was bid; of an excellent and superior\ncharacter, modest, taciturn, peaceable, and mild; always agreeing\nwith anything or any one, disputing nothing, and neither contradicting\nhimself nor exaggerating. He would mount with measured step the\nstaircase to his bed-chamber, even were a cannon-ball behind him; and\nprobably to his dying day would never find an opportunity to fly into a\npassion.\n\nThis man possessed, in a high degree, not only the common courage of\nthe battle-field (that physical bravery due only to nervous strength),\nbut, better still, moral courage, that is to say, firmness of soul. If\nhe had a fault, it was that of being absolutely Scotch from head to\nfoot, a pure-blooded Caledonian, an infatuated observer of the ancient\ncustoms of his country. Through his relationship to the Glenarvans he\nlived at Malcolm Castle; and as major and military man it was very\nnatural that he should be found on board the Duncan.\n\nSuch, then, were the passengers of this yacht, summoned by unforeseen\ncircumstances to accomplish one of the most surprising voyages of\nmodern times. Since her arrival at the wharf at Glasgow, she had\nmonopolized the public attention. A considerable number came every day\nto visit her. They were interested in her alone, and spoke only of her,\nto the great umbrage of the other captains of the port, among others\nCaptain Burton, commanding the Scotia, a magnificent steamer, moored\nbeside the Duncan, and bound for Calcutta. The Scotia, from her size,\nhad a right to consider the Duncan as a mere fly-boat. Nevertheless,\nall the attraction centred in Lord Glenarvan's yacht, and increased\nfrom day to day.\n\nThe time of departure approached. Captain Mangles had shown himself\nskillful and expeditious. A month after her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, the Duncan, laden, provisioned, and equipped, was ready to put\nto sea. The 25th of August was appointed for the time of departure,\nwhich would enable the yacht to reach the southern latitudes by the\nbeginning of spring. Lord Glenarvan, when his plan was matured, did\nnot neglect to make investigations into the hardships and perils of the\nvoyage; yet he did not hesitate on this account, but prepared to leave\nMalcolm Castle.", "On the 24th of August, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, Mary and\nRobert Grant, Mr. Olbinett, the steward of the yacht, and his wife, who\nwas in the service of Lady Glenarvan, left the castle, after taking an\naffectionate farewell of their family servants. Several hours afterward\nthey found themselves on board. Many of the population of Glasgow\nwelcomed with sympathetic admiration the young and courageous lady who\nrenounced the pleasures of a life of luxury, and sailed to the rescue\nof the shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe apartments of Lord Glenarvan and his wife occupied the entire stern\nof the vessel. They consisted of two bed-chambers, a parlor, and two\ndressing-rooms, adjoining which was an open square inclosed by six\ncabins, five of which were occupied by Mary and Robert Grant, Mr. and\nMrs. Olbinett, and Major MacNabb. As for the cabins of the captain and\nthe mate, they were situated in the forecastle, and opened on the deck.\nThe crew were lodged between-decks very comfortably, for the yacht of\ncourse carried nothing but her coal, provisions, and armament.\n\nThe Duncan was to start on the night of the 24th, as the tide fell at\nthree o'clock in the morning. But first those who were present were\nwitness to a touching scene. At eight in the evening Lord Glenarvan and\nhis companions, the entire crew, from the firemen to the captain, all\nwho were to take part in this voyage of sacrifice, left the yacht, and\nbetook themselves to Saint Mungo, the ancient cathedral of Glasgow.\nThis antique church, an uninjured relic in the midst of the ruins\ncaused by the Reformation, and so marvelously described by Walter\nScott, received beneath its massive arches the owners and sailors of\nthe Duncan.\n\n[Sidenote: PRAYER, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nA numerous throng accompanied them. There in the spacious aisle,\nfilled with tombs of the great and good, the Rev. Mr. Morton implored\nthe blessing of Heaven, and commended the expedition to the care of\nProvidence. For a moment the voice of Mary Grant arose in the old\nchurch. The young girl was praying for her benefactors, and shedding\nbefore God the sweet tears of gratitude. The assembly retired under the\ninfluence of a deep emotion.\n\nAt eleven, every one was on board. The captain and the crew occupied\nthemselves with the final preparations. At midnight the fires were\nkindled, and soon clouds of black smoke mingled with the vapors of the\nnight; the sails of the Duncan had been carefully reefed in a canvas\nsheathing, which served to protect them from injury. The wind blew from\nthe southeast, and did not favor the progress of the vessel; but at two\no'clock the ship began to heave under the action of her boilers. The\nmanometer indicated a pressure of four atmospheres, and the overheated\nsteam whistled through the escape-valves. The sea was tranquil, and\nsoon daylight enabled them to distinguish the passes of the Clyde\nbetween the buoys and beacons, whose lights were gradually extinguished\nas the morning dawned.\n\nCaptain Mangles informed Lord Glenarvan, who at once came on deck. Very\nsoon the ebb-tide was felt. The Duncan gave a few shrill whistles,\nslackened her cables, and separated from the surrounding vessels. Her\nscrew was set in motion, which propelled her into the channel of the\nriver. The captain had taken no pilot. He was perfectly acquainted with\nthe navigation of the Clyde, and no one could have commanded better. At\na sign from him the yacht started. With his right hand he controlled\nthe engine, and with his left the tiller, with silent but unerring\nskill.\n\n[Illustration: The Rev. Mr. Morton implored the blessing of Heaven, and\ncommended the expedition to the care of Providence.]\n\n[Sidenote: A CHANGE OF SCENE.]\n\nSoon the last workshops on the shore gave place to villas, built here\nand there upon the hills, and the sounds of the city died away in the\ndistance. An hour afterwards, the Duncan passed the rocks of Dumbarton;\ntwo hours later she was in the Frith of Clyde; and at six o'clock in\nthe morning she doubled Cantyre Point, emerged from the North Channel,\nand gained the open sea.\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nAN UNEXPECTED PASSENGER.\n\n\nDuring the first day's voyage the sea was quite rough, and the wind\nfreshened towards evening. The Duncan rolled considerably, so that\nthe ladies did not appear on deck, but very wisely remained in their\ncabins. The next day the wind changed a point, and the captain set the\nmain-, fore-, and foretop-sails, thus causing less perception of the\nrolling and pitching motion.\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant were able before daybreak to join Lord\nGlenarvan, the major, and the captain, on deck. The sunrise was\nmagnificent. The orb of day, like a gilded metal disk, rose from the\nocean, as from an immense and silvery basin. The ship glided in the\nmidst of a splendid iridescence, and you would truly have thought that\nher sails expanded under the influence of the sun's rays, whilst even\nthe crew of the yacht silently admired this reappearance of the orb of\nday.\n\n\"What a magnificent spectacle!\" said Lady Helena, at last. \"This is\nthe beginning of a beautiful day. May the wind not prove contrary, but\nfavor the progress of the Duncan!\"\n\n\"No better weather could be desired, my dear Helena,\" replied Lord\nGlenarvan; \"we have no reason to complain of the commencement of the\nvoyage.\"\n\n\"Will it be a long one, my dear Edward?\"\n\n\"That is for the captain to answer,\" said he. \"Are we progressing well?\nAre you satisfied with your vessel, captain?\"\n\n\"Very well indeed,\" was the answer. \"She is a marvelous craft, and a\nsailor likes to feel her under his feet. Never were hull and engine\nmore in unison. See how smooth her wake is, and how easily she rides\nthe waves. We are moving at the rate of seventeen knots an hour. If\nthis continues, we shall cross the line in ten days, and in five weeks\nshall double Cape Horn.\"\n\n\"You hear, Mary,\" said Lady Helena: \"in five weeks!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the young girl, \"I hear; and my heart beat quickly at\nthe words of the captain.\"\n\n\"And how do you bear this voyage, Miss Mary?\" inquired Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\"Very well, my lord; I do not experience very many discomforts.\nBesides, I shall soon be accustomed to it.\"\n\n\"And young Robert?\"\n\n[Sidenote: COMPLIMENTS AND CONGRATULATIONS.]\n\n\"Oh, Robert!\" replied Captain Mangles: \"when he is not engaged with the\nengine he is perched at mast-head. I tell you he is a boy who mocks\nsea-sickness. Only look at him!\"\n\nAt a gesture of the captain, all eyes were turned towards the mainmast,\nand every one could perceive Robert, suspended by the stays of the\nforetop-gallant sail, a hundred feet aloft. Mary could not restrain a\nmotion of fear.\n\n\"Oh, be easy, miss!\" said Captain Mangles. \"I will answer for him, and\npromise you I will present, in a short time, a famous sailor to Captain\nGrant; for we shall find that worthy captain.\"\n\n\"May Heaven hear you, sir!\" replied the young girl.\n\n\"My dear child,\" said Lord Glenarvan, \"there is in all this something\nprovidential, which ought to give us hope. We are not merely going, we\nare led; we are not seeking blindly, we are guided. And then see all\nthese brave people enrolled in the service of so good a cause. Not only\nshall we succeed in our enterprise, but it will be accomplished without\ndifficulty. I have promised Lady Helena a pleasure voyage; and, if I am\nnot mistaken, I shall keep my word.\"\n\n\"Edward,\" said Lady Glenarvan, \"you are the best of men.\"\n\n\"Not so; but I have the best of crews, on the best of ships. Do you not\nwonder at our Duncan, Miss Mary?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, my lord,\" answered the young girl, \"I don't so much\nwonder as admire; for I am well acquainted with ships.\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed!\"\n\n\"When a mere child, I played on my father's ships. He ought to have\nmade a sailor of me. If it were necessary, perhaps I should not now be\nembarrassed in taking a reef or twisting a gasket.\"\n\n\"What is that you're saying, miss?\" exclaimed the captain.\n\n\"If you talk so,\" continued Lord Glenarvan, \"you will make a great\nfriend of Captain John; for he thinks nothing in the world can equal\nthe life of a sailor. He sees no other, even for a woman. Is it not so,\nJohn?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, your lordship,\" replied the young captain; \"and yet, I\nconfess, Miss Grant is better in her place on deck, than taking a reef\nin the top-sail. But still I am very much flattered to hear her speak\nso.\"\n\n\"And especially when she admires the Duncan!\" added Glenarvan.\n\n\"Right, my lord; for she deserves it.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Lady Helena, \"since you are so proud of your\nyacht, you make me anxious to examine her to the very hold, and see how\nour brave sailors are quartered between-decks.\"\n\n\"Admirably,\" replied the captain; \"they are quite at home there.\"\n\n\"Indeed they are, my dear Helena,\" said Lord Glenarvan. \"This yacht\nis a part of our old Caledonia,--a detached portion of the county of\nDumbarton, traveling by special favor, so that we have not left our\ncountry. The Duncan is Malcolm Castle, and the ocean is Loch Lomond.\"\n\n\"Well, then, my dear Edward, do the honors of the castle,\" said Lady\nHelena.\n\n\"I am at your disposal, madam,\" answered her husband; \"but first let me\ninform Olbinett.\"\n\nThe steward of the yacht was an excellent manager, a Scotchman, who\ndeserved to have been a Frenchman from his self-importance, and,\nmoreover, fulfilled his duties with zeal and intelligence. He was at\nonce ready for his master's commands.\n\n\"Olbinett, we are going to make a tour of the vessel before breakfast,\"\nsaid Glenarvan, as if a journey to Tarbet or Loch Katrine was in\nquestion. \"I hope we shall find the table ready on our return.\"\n\nOlbinett bowed gravely.\n\n[Illustration: This man, tall, lank, and shriveled, might have been\nforty years old. He resembled a long, broad-headed nail, for his head\nwas large and thick, his forehead high, his nose prominent, his mouth\nwide, and his chin blunt.]\n\n\"Do you accompany us, major?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"If you order it,\" replied MacNabb.", "\"Do you accompany us, major?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"If you order it,\" replied MacNabb.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Lord Glenarvan, \"the major is absorbed in the smoke of his\ncigar; we must not disturb him, for I assure you he is an inveterate\nsmoker, Miss Mary; he smokes all the time, even in his sleep.\"\n\nThe major made a sign of assent, and the passengers descended\nbetween-decks.\n\nMacNabb remained alone, talking to himself, according to his custom,\nbut never contradicting himself. Enveloped in a dense cloud of smoke,\nhe stood motionless, gazing back at the wake of the yacht. After a few\nmoments of contemplation, he turned and found himself face to face with\na new character. If _anything_ could have surprised him, it must have\nbeen this meeting, for the passenger was absolutely unknown to him.\n\n[Sidenote: A TELESCOPIC APPARITION.]\n\nThis man, tall, lank, and shriveled, might have been forty years old.\nHe resembled a long, broad-headed nail, for his head was large and\nthick, his forehead high, his nose prominent, his mouth wide, and\nhis chin blunt. As for his eyes, they were hidden behind enormous\neye-glasses, and his look seemed to have that indecision peculiar\nto nyctalops. His countenance indicated an intelligent and lively\nperson, while it had not the crabbed air of those stern people who from\nprinciple never laugh, and whose stupidity is hidden beneath a serious\nguise. The nonchalance and amiable freedom of this unknown nonentity\nclearly proved that he knew how to take men and things at their best\nadvantage. Even without his speaking you felt that he was a talker; but\nhe was abstracted, after the manner of those who do not see what they\nare looking at or hear what they are listening to. He wore a traveling\ncap, stout yellow buskins and leather gaiters, pantaloons of maroon\nvelvet, and a jacket of the same material, whose innumerable pockets\nseemed stuffed with note-books, memoranda, scraps, portfolios, and a\nthousand articles as inconvenient as they were useless, not to speak\nof a telescope which he carried in a sling.\n\nThe curiosity of this unknown being was a singular contrast to the\ncalmness of the major. He walked around MacNabb, and gazed at him\nquestioningly, whilst the latter did not trouble himself whence the\nstranger came, whither he was going, or why he was on board the Duncan.\n\nWhen this enigmatical character saw his approaches mocked by the\nindifference of the major, he seized his telescope, which at its full\nlength measured four feet; and motionless, with legs straddled, like a\nsign-post on a highway, he pointed his instrument to the line where sky\nand water met. After a few moments of examination, he lowered it, and\nresting it on the deck, leaned upon it as upon a cane. But immediately\nthe joints of the instrument closed, and the newly discovered\npassenger, whose point of support suddenly failed, was stretched at the\nfoot of the mainmast.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAny one else in the major's place would at least have smiled, but he\ndid not even wink. The unknown then assumed his r\u00f4le.\n\n\"Steward!\" he cried, with an accent that betokened a foreigner.\n\nHe waited. No one appeared.\n\n\"Steward!\" he repeated, in a louder tone.\n\nMr. Olbinett was passing just then on his way to the kitchen under the\nforecastle. What was his astonishment to hear himself thus addressed by\nthis tall individual, who was utterly unknown to him!\n\n\"Where did this person come from?\" said he to himself. \"A friend of\nLord Glenarvan? It is impossible.\"\n\nHowever, he came on deck, and approached the stranger.\n\n\"Are you the steward of the vessel?\" the latter asked him.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Olbinett; \"but I have not the honor----\"\n\n\"I am the passenger of cabin number six.\"\n\n\"Number six?\" repeated the steward.\n\n\"Certainly; and your name is----?\"\n\n\"Olbinett.\"\n\n\"Well, Olbinett, my friend,\" answered the stranger of cabin number six,\n\"I must think of dinner, and acutely, too. For thirty-six hours I have\neaten nothing, or, rather, have slept, which is pardonable in a man\ncome all the way from Paris to Glasgow. What hour do you dine, if you\nplease?\"\n\n\"At nine o'clock,\" answered Olbinett, mechanically.\n\nThe stranger attempted to consult his watch; but this took some time,\nfor he did not find it till he came to his ninth pocket.\n\n[Sidenote: CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED.]\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"it is not yet eight o'clock; therefore, Olbinett, a\nbiscuit and a glass of sherry for the present; for I am fainting with\nhunger.\"\n\nOlbinett listened without understanding. Moreover, the unknown kept\ntalking, and passed from one subject to another with extreme volubility.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"has not the captain risen yet? And the mate? What is\nhe doing? Is he asleep, too? Fortunately, the weather is beautiful, the\nwind favorable, and the ship goes on quite by herself----\"\n\nJust as he said this, Captain Mangles appeared at the companion-way.\n\n\"Here is the captain,\" said Olbinett.\n\n\"Ah, I am delighted,\" cried the stranger, \"delighted to make your\nacquaintance, Captain Burton!\"\n\nIf any one was ever astounded, John Mangles certainly was, not less at\nhearing himself called \"Captain Burton,\" than at seeing this stranger\non board his vessel.\n\nThe latter continued, with more animation:\n\n\"Permit me to shake hands with you, and if I did not do so day before\nyesterday, it was that no one might be embarrassed at the moment of\ndeparture. But to-day, captain, I am truly happy to meet you.\"\n\nCaptain Mangles opened his eyes in measureless astonishment, looking\nfirst at Olbinett, and then at the new comer.\n\n\"Now,\" continued the latter, \"the introduction is over, and we are old\nfriends. Let us have a talk; and tell me, are you satisfied with the\nScotia?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by the Scotia?\" asked the captain, at last.\n\n\"Why, the Scotia that carries us: a good ship, whose commander, the\nbrave Captain Burton, I have heard praised no less for his physical\nthan his moral qualities. Are you the father of the great African\ntraveler of that name? If so, my compliments!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"not only am I not the father of the\ntraveler Burton, but I am not even Captain Burton.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the unknown, \"it is the mate of the Scotia then, Mr.\nBurdness, whom I am addressing at this moment?\"\n\n\"Mr. Burdness?\" replied Captain Mangles, who began to suspect the\ntruth. But was he talking to a fool, or a rogue? This was a question in\nhis mind, and he was about to explain himself intelligibly, when Lord\nGlenarvan, his wife, and Miss Grant came on deck.\n\nThe stranger perceived them, and cried,--\n\n\"Ah! passengers! passengers! excellent! I hope, Mr. Burdness, you are\ngoing to introduce me----\"\n\nAnd advancing with perfect ease, without waiting for the captain,--\n\n\"Madam\" said he to Miss Grant, \"Miss\" to Lady Helena, \"Sir\" he added,\naddressing Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\"Lord Glenarvan,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"My lord,\" continued the unknown, \"I beg your pardon for introducing\nmyself, but at sea we must relax a little from etiquette. I hope we\nshall soon be acquainted, and that, in the society of these ladies, the\npassage of the Scotia will seem as short to us as agreeable.\"\n\nLady Helena and Miss Grant could not find a word to answer. They were\ncompletely bewildered by the presence of this intruder.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Glenarvan, at length, \"whom have I the honor of addressing?\"\n\n\"Jacques Eliacim Fran\u00e7ois Marie Paganel, secretary of the Geographical\nSociety of Paris; corresponding member of the societies of Berlin,\nBombay, Darmstadt, Leipsic, London, St. Petersburg, Vienna, and New\nYork; honorary member of the Royal Geographical and Ethnographical\nInstitute of the East Indies, who, after passing twenty years of his\nlife in studying geography, designs now to enter upon a roving life,\nand is directing his course to India to continue there the labors of\nthe great travelers.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nJACQUES PAGANEL IS UNDECEIVED.\n\n\nThe secretary of the Geographical Society must have been an agreeable\nperson, for all this was said with much modesty. Lord Glenarvan,\nmoreover, knew perfectly whom he had met. The name and merit of Jacques\nPaganel were well known to him. His geographical labors, his reports\non modern discoveries, published in the bulletins of the Society, his\ncorrespondence with the entire world, had made him one of the most\ndistinguished scientific men of France. Thus Glenarvan extended his\nhand very cordially to his unexpected guest.\n\n\"And now that our introduction is over,\" added he, \"will you permit me,\nMonsieur Paganel, to ask you a question?\"\n\n\"Twenty, my lord,\" replied Jacques Paganel; \"it will always be a\npleasure to converse with you.\"\n\n\"You arrived on board this vessel the day before yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord, day before yesterday, at eight o'clock in the evening.\nI took a cab from the Caledonian Railway to the Scotia, in which I had\nengaged cabin number six at Paris. The night was dark. I saw no one on\nboard. Feeling fatigued by thirty hours of travel, and knowing that\na good way to avoid sea-sickness is to go to bed on embarking, and\nnot stir from your bunk for the first days of the voyage, I retired\nimmediately, and have conscientiously slept thirty-six hours, I assure\nyou.\"\n\nJacques Paganel's hearers now knew the reason of his presence on board.\nThe Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of\nthe Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was\nexplained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage?\n\n\"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my\nlife. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the\ncountry of the elephants and the Thugs.\"\n\n\"Then you would not care to visit another country?\"", "\"Then you would not care to visit another country?\"\n\n\"No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from\nLord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the\nGeographical Society which I must fulfil.\"\n\n\"Ah! you have a mission?\"\n\n\"Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of\nwhich has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M.\nVivien de Saint Martin. It is to follow in the steps of the brothers\nSchlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed\nwhere Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846. In a word, I wish\nto discover the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo, which waters Thibet,\nand finally to settle whether this river does not join the Brahmapootra\nin the northeast part of Assam. A gold medal is promised to that\ntraveler who shall succeed in supplying this much-needed information on\nIndian geography.\"\n\nPaganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was\ncarried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been\nas impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of\nSchaffhausen.\n\n\"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment\nof silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which\nscience would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your\nignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing\nIndia.\"\n\n\n\"Give it up! And why?\"\n\n\"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\"\n\n\"How? Captain Burton----\"\n\n\"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles.\n\n\"But the Scotia?\"\n\n\"This vessel is not the Scotia.\"\n\nPaganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord\nGlenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose\nfeatures expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain\nMangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising\nhis shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his\neyes, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"What a joke!\"\n\nBut at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were\ninscribed these two words, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and,\nleaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin.\n\nWhen the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board,\nexcept the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated\neven to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake\nthe vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was\nthe height of absent-mindedness.\n\n[Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.]\n\n\"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques\nPaganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders. He once\npublished a celebrated map of America, in which he located Japan.\nHowever, he is a distinguished scholar, and one of the best geographers\nof France.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"But what are we going to do with the poor gentleman?\" asked Lady\nHelena. \"We cannot take him to Patagonia.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" replied MacNabb gravely. \"We are not responsible for his\nerrors. Suppose he were in a railroad car, would it stop for him?\"\n\n\"No; but he could get out at the first station,\" answered Lady Helena.\n\n\"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"he can do so now, if he pleases, at our first\nlanding.\"\n\nAt this moment Paganel, woeful and humble, reappeared on deck, after\nconvincing himself that his baggage was on board. He kept repeating\nthose fatal words: \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" He could find no others\nin his vocabulary. He went to and fro, examining the rigging of the\nyacht, and questioning the mute horizon of the open sea. At last he\nreturned to Lord Glenarvan.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"And this Duncan is going----?\" he asked.\n\n\"To America, Monsieur Paganel.\"\n\n\"And where especially?\"\n\n\"To Concepcion.\"\n\n\"To Chili! to Chili!\" cried the unfortunate geographer. \"And my mission\nto India! But what will M. de Quatrefages say, the President of the\nCentral Commission? How shall I represent myself at the sessions of the\nSociety?\"\n\n[Sidenote: COURTESY AND CONVERSE.]\n\n\"Come, monsieur,\" said Glenarvan, \"do not despair. Everything can\nbe arranged, and you will only have to submit to a delay of little\nconsequence. The Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo will wait for you in the mountains\nof Thibet. We shall soon reach Madeira, and there you will find a\nvessel to take you back to Europe.\"\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, and must be resigned. But we can say this is an\nextraordinary adventure, which would not have happened but for me. And\nmy cabin which is engaged on board the Scotia?\"\n\n\"Oh, as for the Scotia, I advise you to give her up for the present.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Paganel after examining the vessel again, \"the Duncan is a\npleasure yacht.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"and belongs to his lordship, Lord\nGlenarvan----\"\n\n\"Who begs you to make free use of his hospitality,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"A thousand thanks, my lord,\" replied Paganel; \"I am truly sensible\nto your courtesy. But permit me to make a simple remark. India is a\nbeautiful country. It offers marvelous surprises to travelers. These\nladies have probably never visited it. Well, the man at the helm needs\nonly to give a turn to the wheel, and the Duncan will go as easily to\nCalcutta as Concepcion. Now, since this is a pleasure voyage----\"\n\nThe negative reception that met Paganel's proposal did not permit him\nto develop it. He paused.\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel,\" said Lady Helena at length, \"if this were only a\npleasure voyage, I would answer: 'Let us all go to India,' and Lord\nGlenarvan would not disapprove. But the Duncan is going to recover\nsome shipwrecked sailors, abandoned on the coast of Patagonia; and she\ncannot change so humane a course.\"\n\nIn a few moments the Frenchman was acquainted with the situation of\naffairs, and learned, not without emotion, the providential discovery\nof the documents, the story of Captain Grant, and Lady Helena's\ngenerous proposal.\n\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"permit me to admire your conduct in all this, and to\nadmire it without reserve. May your yacht continue on her course; I\nwould reproach myself for delaying her a single day.\"\n\n\"Will you then join in our search?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"It is impossible, madam; I must fulfil my mission. I shall disembark\nat your first landing.\"\n\n\"At Madeira then,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"At Madeira let it be. I shall be only one hundred and eighty leagues\nfrom Lisbon, and will wait there for means of further conveyance.\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"it shall be as you desire;\nand, for my part, I am happy that I can offer you for a few days the\nhospitalities of my vessel. May you not grow weary of our company.\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord,\" exclaimed the geographer, \"I am still too happy in being\nso agreeably disappointed. However, it is a very ludicrous situation\nfor a man who takes passage for India, and is sailing to America.\"\n\nIn spite of this mortifying reflection, Paganel made the best use of a\ndelay that he could not avoid. He showed himself amiable, and even gay;\nhe enchanted the ladies with his good humor, and before the end of the\nday he was the friend of every one. At his request the famous document\nwas shown to him. He studied it carefully, long and minutely. No other\ninterpretation appeared to him possible. Mary Grant and her brother\ninspired him with the liveliest interest. He gave them good hopes. His\nway of distinguishing the events, and the undeniable success that he\npredicted for the Duncan, elicited a smile from the young girl.\n\n[Sidenote: THIS, OR THAT, OR NEITHER.]\n\nAs to Lady Helena, when he learned that she was the daughter of William\nTuffnel, there was an outburst of surprise and admiration. He had known\nher father. What a bold discoverer! How many letters they had exchanged\nwhen the latter was corresponding member of the Society! He it was who\nhad introduced him to M. Malte-Brun. What a meeting! and how much\npleasure to travel with the daughter of such a man! Finally, he asked\nLady Helena's permission to kiss her, to which she consented, although\nit was perhaps a little \"improper.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE GEOGRAPHER'S RESOLUTION.\n\n\nMeanwhile the yacht, favored by the currents, was advancing rapidly\ntowards the equator. In a few days the island of Madeira came in view.\nGlenarvan, faithful to his promise, offered to land his new guest here.\n\n\"My dear lord,\" replied Paganel, \"I will not be formal with you. Before\nmy arrival on board, did you intend to stop at Madeira?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Well, permit me to profit by the consequences of my unlucky blunder.\nMadeira is an island too well known. Everything has been said and\nwritten about it; and it is, moreover, rapidly declining in point of\ncivilization. If, then, it is all the same to you, let us land at the\nCanaries.\"\n\n\"Very well, at the Canaries,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That will not take us\nout of our way.\"\n\n\"I know it, my dear lord. At the Canaries, you see, there are three\ngroups to study, not to speak of the Peak of Teneriffe, which I have\nalways desired to see. This is a fine opportunity. I will profit by\nit; and, while waiting for a vessel, will attempt the ascent of this\ncelebrated mountain.\"\n\n\"As you please, my dear Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan, who could not help\nsmiling, and with good reason.\n\nThe Canaries are only a short distance from Madeira, scarcely two\nhundred and fifty miles, a mere trifle for so good a vessel as the\nDuncan.\n\nThe same day, at two o'clock in the afternoon, Captain Mangles and\nPaganel were walking on the deck. The Frenchman pressed his companion\nwith lively questions concerning Chili. All at once the captain\ninterrupted him, and pointing towards the southern horizon, said,--\n\n\"Mr. Paganel!\"\n\n\"My dear captain,\" replied the geographer.\n\n\"Please cast your eyes in that direction. Do you see nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"You are not looking right. It is not on the horizon, but above, in the\nclouds.\"\n\n\"In the clouds? I look in vain.\"", "\"Please cast your eyes in that direction. Do you see nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"You are not looking right. It is not on the horizon, but above, in the\nclouds.\"\n\n\"In the clouds? I look in vain.\"\n\n\"Stop, now, just on a line with the end of the bowsprit.\"\n\n\"I see nothing.\"\n\n\"You do not wish to see. However that may be, although we are forty\nmiles distant, you understand, the Peak of Teneriffe is visible above\nthe horizon.\"\n\nWhether Paganel wished to see or not, he had to yield to the evidence\nsome hours afterwards, or, at least, confess himself blind.\n\n\"You perceive it now?\" said his companion.\n\n\"Yes, yes, perfectly!\" replied Paganel. \"And that,\" added he in a\ncontemptuous tone, \"is what you call the Peak of Teneriffe?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"It appears to be of very moderate height.\"\n\n\"Yet it is eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea.\"\n\n\"Not so high as Mont Blanc.\"\n\n\"Very possibly; but when you come to climb it, you will find it,\nperhaps, high enough.\"\n\n[Illustration: They could scarcely see the city, which was on an\nelevated plain in the form of a terrace, resting on volcanic rocks\nthree hundred feet in height. The appearance of the island through this\nrainy curtain was misty.]\n\n\"Oh! climb it, my dear captain? What is the use, I ask you, after\nHumboldt and Bonpland? What can I do after these great men?\"\n\n[Illustration: Peak of Teneriffe.]\n\n\"Indeed,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"there is nothing left but to wander\nabout. It is a pity, for you would be very tired waiting for a vessel\nat Teneriffe. You cannot look for many distractions there.\"\n\n\"Except my own,\" said Paganel, laughing. \"But, my dear captain, have\nnot the Cape Verd Islands important landings?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Nothing is easier than to land at Villa-Pra\u00efa.\"\n\n\"Not to speak of an advantage that is not to be despised,\" answered\nPaganel; \"that the Cape Verd Islands are not far from Senegal, where I\nshall find fellow-countrymen.\"\n\n\"As you please, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"I am certain\nthat geographical science will gain by your sojourn in these islands.\nWe must land there to take in coal; you will, therefore, cause us no\ndelay.\"\n\n[Sidenote: DECLINED, WITH THANKS.]\n\nSo saying, the captain gave the order to pass to the southeast of the\nCanaries. The celebrated peak was soon left on the larboard; and the\nDuncan, continuing her rapid course, cut the Tropic of Cancer the next\nmorning at five o'clock. The weather there changed. The atmosphere\nhad the moisture and oppressiveness of the rainy season, disagreeable\nto travelers, but beneficial to the inhabitants of the African\nislands, who have no trees, and consequently need water. The sea was\nboisterous, and prevented the passengers from remaining on deck; but\nthe conversation in the cabin was not less animated.\n\nThe next day Paganel began to collect his baggage preparatory to\nhis approaching departure. In a short time they entered the bay of\nVilla-Pra\u00efa, and anchored opposite the city in eight fathoms of\nwater. The weather was stormy and the surf high, although the bay was\nsheltered from the winds. The rain fell in torrents so that they could\nscarcely see the city, which was on an elevated plain in the form of a\nterrace, resting on volcanic rocks three hundred feet in height. The\nappearance of the island through this rainy curtain was misty.\n\nShipping the coal was not accomplished without great difficulty, and\nthe passengers saw themselves confined to the cabin, while sea and\nsky mingled their waters in an indescribable tumult. The weather was,\ntherefore, the topic of conversation on board. Each one had his say\nexcept the major, who would have witnessed the deluge itself with\nperfect indifference. Paganel walked to and fro, shaking his head.\n\n\"It is an imperative fact,\" said he.\n\n\"It is certain,\" replied Glenarvan, \"that the elements declare\nthemselves against you.\"\n\n\"I will see about that.\"\n\n\"You cannot face such a storm,\" said Lady Helena.\n\n\"I, madam? Certainly. I fear only for my baggage and instruments. They\nwill all be lost.\"\n\n\"Our landing is the only thing doubtful,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"Once\nat Villa-Pra\u00efa, you will not have very uncomfortable quarters; rather\nuncleanly, to be sure, in the company of monkeys and swine, whose\nsurroundings are not always agreeable; but a traveler does not regard\nthat so critically. Besides, you can hope in seven or eight months to\nembark for Europe.\"\n\n\"Seven or eight months!\" exclaimed Paganel.\n\n\"At least that. The Cape Verd Islands are very rarely frequented\nduring the rainy season. But you can employ your time profitably. This\narchipelago is still little known. There is much to do, even now.\"\n\n\"But,\" replied Paganel in a pitiful tone, \"what could I do after the\ninvestigations of the geologist Deville?\"\n\n\"That is really a pity,\" said Lady Helena. \"What will become of you,\nMonsieur Paganel?\"\n\nPaganel was silent for a few moments.\n\n\"You had decidedly better have landed at Madeira,\" rejoined Glenarvan,\n\"although there is no wine there.\"\n\n\"My dear Glenarvan,\" continued Paganel at last, \"where shall you land\nnext?\"\n\n\"At Concepcion.\"\n\n\"Alas! but that would bring me directly away from India!\"\n\n\"No; for when you have passed Cape Horn you approach the Indies.\"\n\n\"I very much doubt it.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" continued Glenarvan with the greatest gravity, \"as long as\nyou are at the Indies, what difference does it make whether they are\nthe East or the West?\"\n\n\"'What difference does it make'?\"\n\n\"The inhabitants of the Pampas of Patagonia are Indians as well as the\nnatives of the Punjab.\"\n\n\"Eh! my lord,\" exclaimed Paganel, \"that is a reason I should never have\nimagined!\"\n\n[Sidenote: BAIT FOR A TRAVELLER.]\n\n\"And then, my dear Paganel, you know that you can gain the gold medal\nin any country whatever. There is something to do, to seek, to\ndiscover, everywhere, in the chains of the Cordilleras as well as the\nmountains of Thibet.\"\n\n\"But the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo?\"\n\n\"Certainly. You can replace that by the Rio Colorado. This is a river\nvery little known, and one of those which flow on the map too much\naccording to the fancy of the geographer.\"\n\n\"I know it, my dear lord; there are errors of several degrees. I do not\ndoubt that at my request the Society would have sent me to Patagonia as\nwell as to India; but I did not think of it.\"\n\n\"The result of your continual abstraction.\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Paganel, shall you accompany us?\" asked Lady Helena in\nher most persuasive tone.\n\n\"And my mission, madam?\"\n\n\"I inform you that we shall pass through the Strait of Magellan,\"\ncontinued Glenarvan.\n\n\"My lord, you are a tempter.\"\n\n\"I add that we shall visit Port Famine.\"\n\n\"Port Famine!\" cried the Frenchman, assailed on all sides; \"that port\nso celebrated in geographical fasts!\"\n\n\"Consider also, Monsieur Paganel,\" continued Lady Helena, \"that in this\nenterprise you will have the right to associate the name of France with\nthat of Scotland.\"\n\n\"Yes; doubtless.\"\n\n\"A geographer may be very serviceable to our expedition; and what is\nmore noble than for science to enlist in the service of humanity?\"\n\n\"That is well said, madam.\"\n\n\"Believe me, try chance, or rather Providence. Imitate us. It has sent\nus this document; we have started. It has cast you on board the Duncan;\ndo not leave her.\"\n\n\"And do you, indeed, wish me, my good friends?\" replied Paganel. \"Well,\nyou desire me to stay very much?\"\n\n\"And you, Paganel, you are dying to stay,\" retorted Glenarvan.\n\n\"Truly,\" cried the geographer, \"but I fear I am very indiscreet.\"\n\nThus far the Duncan had acquitted herself admirably: in every way her\npowers for steaming or sailing had been sufficiently tested, and her\ncaptain and passengers were alike satisfied with her performance and\nwith one another.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHROUGH THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN.\n\n\nThe joy on board was general, when Paganel's resolution was known.\nYoung Robert threw himself on his neck with very demonstrative\ndelight. The worthy geographer almost fell backwards. \"A rough little\ngentleman,\" said he; \"I will teach him geography.\" As Captain Mangles\nhad engaged to make him a sailor, Glenarvan a man of honor, the major a\nboy of coolness, Lady Helena a noble and generous being, and Mary Grant\na pupil grateful towards such patrons, Robert was evidently to become\none day an accomplished gentleman.\n\nThe Duncan soon finished shipping her coal, and then leaving these\ngloomy regions she gained the current from the southeast coast of\nBrazil, and, after crossing the equator with a fine breeze from the\nnorth, she entered the southern hemisphere. The passage was effected\nwithout difficulty, and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in\nsearch of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their\ncaptain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence\nproceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at\nheart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly\ninterested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well,\nthat, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had\nperceived it.\n\nAs for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the\nsouthern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which\nhe covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with\nMr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table.", "But Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major,\nwho was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at\ndinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching.\n\nIn the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores.\n\nThe vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered\nwithout hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels\nbound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and\nseventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep\nwater, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of\nwater. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe\nand easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources\nthat are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks\nof Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests.\n\n[Illustration: Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves.]\n\nDuring the first hours of the passage, till you reach Cape Gregory,\nthe shores are low and sandy. The entire passage lasted scarcely\nthirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well\nrewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant\nbeams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the\ncontinent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of\nTerra del Fuego.\n\nAt one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between\ntwo magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous\nmasses of granite. The base of the mountains was hidden in the heart\nof immense forests, while their summits, whitened with eternal snow,\nwere lost in the clouds. Towards the southeast Mount Taru towered\nsix thousand five hundred feet aloft. Night came, preceded by a long\ntwilight, the light melting away insensibly by gentle degrees, while\nthe sky was studded with brilliant stars.\n\nIn the midst of this partial obscurity, the yacht boldly continued on\nher course, without casting anchor in the safe bays with which the\nshores abound. Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves. At others her propeller would\nbeat the waters of the great rivers, starting geese, ducks, snipe,\nteal, and all the feathered tribes of the marshes. Soon deserted ruins\nappeared, and fallen monuments, to which the night lent a grand aspect;\nthese were the mournful remains of an abandoned colony, whose name\nwill be an eternal contradiction to the fertility of the coasts and\nthe rich game of the forests. It was Port Famine, the place that the\nSpaniard Sarmiento colonized in 1581 with four hundred emigrants. Here\nhe founded the city of San Felipe. But the extreme severity of the cold\nweakened the colony; famine devoured those whom the winter had spared,\nand in 1587 the explorer Cavendish found the last of these four hundred\nunfortunates dying of hunger amid the ruins of a city only six years in\nexistence.\n\n[Sidenote: CHEERLESS MEMORIES.]\n\nThe vessel coasted along these deserted shores. At daybreak she sailed\nin the midst of the narrow passes, between beeches, ash-trees, and\nbirches, from the bosom of which emerged ivy-clad domes, cupolas\ntapestried with the hardy holly, and lofty spires, among which the\nobelisk of Buckland rose to a great height. Far out in the sea sported\ndroves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting,\nwhich could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled\nCape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter. On the other\nside of the strait, on Terra del Fuego, rose Mount Sarmiento to the\nheight of six thousand feet, an enormous mass of rock broken by bands\nof clouds which formed as it were an aerial archipelago in the sky.\n\n[Illustration: Port Famine.]\n\nCape Froward is the real end of the American continent, for Cape Horn\nis only a lone rock in the sea. Passing this point the strait narrowed\nbetween Brunswick Peninsula, and Desolation Island. Then to fertile\nshores succeeded a line of wild barren coast, cut by a thousand inlets\nof this tortuous labyrinth.\n\nThe Duncan unerringly and unhesitatingly pursued its capricious\nwindings, mingling her columns of smoke with the mists on the rocks.\nWithout lessening her speed, she passed several Spanish factories\nestablished on these deserted shores. At Cape Tamar the strait widened.\nThe yacht rounded the Narborough Islands, and approached the southern\nshores. At last, thirty-six hours after entering the strait, the rocks\nof Cape Pilares were discerned at the extreme point of Desolation\nIsland. An immense open glittering sea extended before her prow, and\nJacques Paganel, hailing it with an enthusiastic gesture, felt moved\nlike Ferdinand Magellan himself, when the sails of the Trinidad swelled\nbefore the breezes of the Pacific.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE COURSE DECIDED.\n\n\nEight days after doubling Cape Pilares the Duncan entered at full speed\nthe Bay of Talcahuana, a magnificent estuary, twelve miles long and\nnine broad. The weather was beautiful. Not a cloud is seen in the sky\nof this country from November to March, and the wind from the south\nblows continually along these coasts, which are protected by the chain\nof the Andes.\n\nCaptain Mangles, according to Lord Glenarvan's orders, had kept close\nto the shore of the continent, examining the numerous wrecks that lined\nit. A waif, a broken spar, a piece of wood fashioned by the hand of\nman, might guide the Duncan to the scene of the shipwreck. But nothing\nwas seen, and the yacht continued her course and anchored in the harbor\nof Talcahuana forty-two days after her departure from the waters of the\nClyde.\n\n[Sidenote: LEARNING SPANISH!]\n\nGlenarvan at once lowered the boat, and, followed by Paganel, landed\nat the foot of the palisade. The learned geographer, profiting by the\ncircumstance, would have made use of the language which he had studied\nso conscientiously; but, to his great astonishment, he could not make\nhimself understood by the natives.\n\n\"The accent is what I need,\" said he.\n\n\"Let us go to the Custom-house,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\nThere they were informed by means of several English words, accompanied\nby expressive gestures, that the British consul resided at Concepcion.\nIt was only an hour's journey. Glenarvan easily found two good horses,\nand, a short time after, Paganel and he entered the walls of this great\ncity, which was built by the enterprising genius of Valdivia, the\nvaliant companion of Pizarro.\n\nHow greatly it had declined from its ancient splendor! Often pillaged\nby the natives, burnt in 1819, desolate, ruined, its walls still\nblackened with the flames of devastation, eclipsed by Talcahuana, it\nnow scarcely numbered eight thousand souls. Under the feet of its\nidle inhabitants the streets had grown into prairies. There was no\ncommerce, no activity, no business. The mandolin resounded from every\nbalcony, languishing songs issued from the lattices of the windows, and\nConcepcion, the ancient city of men, had become a village of women and\nchildren.\n\nGlenarvan appeared little desirous of seeking the causes of this\ndecline--though Jacques Paganel attacked him on this subject--and,\nwithout losing an instant, betook himself to the house of J. R.\nBentock, Esq., consul of Her Britannic Majesty. This individual\nreceived him very courteously, and when he learned the story of Captain\nGrant undertook to search along the entire coast.\n\nThe question whether the Britannia had been wrecked on the shores of\nChili or Araucania was decided in the negative. No report of such an\nevent had come either to the consul, or his colleagues in other parts\nof the country.\n\nBut Glenarvan was not discouraged. He returned to Talcahuana, and,\nsparing neither fatigue, trouble, or money, he sent men to the coast,\nbut their search was in vain. The most minute inquiries among the\npeople of the vicinity were of no avail. They were forced to conclude\nthat the Britannia had left no trace of her shipwreck.\n\n[Illustration: In Concepcion.]\n\n[Sidenote: \"TRY AGAIN!\"]\n\nGlenarvan then informed his companions of the failure of his endeavors.\nMary Grant and her brother could not restrain their grief. It was now\nsix days since the arrival of the Duncan at Talcahuana. The passengers\nwere together in the cabin. Lady Helena was consoling, not by her\nwords--for what could she say?--but by her caresses, the two children\nof the captain. Jacques Paganel had taken up the document again, and\nwas regarding it with earnest attention, as if he would have drawn from\nit new secrets. For an hour he had examined it thus, when Glenarvan,\naddressing him, said,--\n\n\"Paganel, I appeal to your sagacity. Is the interpretation we have made\nof this document incorrect? Is the sense of these words illogical?\"\n\nPaganel did not answer. He was reflecting.\n\n\"Are we mistaken as to the supposed scene of the shipwreck?\" continued\nGlenarvan. \"Does not the name Patagonia suggest itself at once to the\nmind?\"\n\nPaganel was still silent.", "\"Are we mistaken as to the supposed scene of the shipwreck?\" continued\nGlenarvan. \"Does not the name Patagonia suggest itself at once to the\nmind?\"\n\nPaganel was still silent.\n\n\"In short,\" said Glenarvan, \"does not the word _Indian_ justify us\nstill more?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" replied MacNabb.\n\n\"And therefore, is it not evident that these shipwrecked men, when they\nwrote these lines, expected to be prisoners of the Indians?\"\n\n\"There you are wrong, my dear lord,\" said Paganel, at last; \"and if\nyour other conclusions are just, the last at least does not seem to me\nrational.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Lady Helena, while all eyes were turned\ntowards the geographer.\n\n\"I mean,\" answered Paganel, emphasizing his words, \"that Captain Grant\nis _now prisoner of the Indians_: and I will add that the document\nleaves no doubt on this point.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, sir,\" said Miss Grant.\n\n\"Nothing is easier, my dear Mary. Instead of reading _they will be\nprisoners_, read _they are prisoners_, and all will be clear.\"\n\n\"But that is impossible,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"Impossible? And why, my noble friend?\" asked Paganel, smiling.\n\n\"Because the bottle must have been thrown when the vessel was breaking\non the rocks. Hence the degrees of longitude and latitude apply to the\nvery place of shipwreck.\"\n\n\"Nothing proves it,\" said Paganel, earnestly; \"and I do not see why\nthe shipwrecked sailors, after being carried by the Indians into the\ninterior of the country, could not have sought to make known by means\nof this bottle the place of their captivity.\"\n\n\"Simply, my dear Paganel, because to throw a bottle into the sea it is\nnecessary, at least, that the sea should be before you.\"\n\n\"Or, in the absence of the sea,\" added Paganel, \"the rivers which flow\ninto it.\"\n\nAn astonished silence followed this unexpected, yet reasonable, answer.\nBy the flash that brightened the eyes of his hearers Paganel knew that\neach of them had conceived a new hope. Lady Helena was the first to\nresume the conversation.\n\n\"What an idea!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"What a _good_ idea!\" added the geographer, simply.\n\n\"Your advice then?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"My advice is to find the thirty-seventh parallel, just where it meets\nthe American coast, and follow it, without deviating half a degree, to\nthe point where it strikes the Atlantic. Perhaps we shall find on its\ncourse the survivors of the Britannia.\"\n\n\"A feeble chance,\" replied the major.\n\n\"However feeble it may be,\" continued Paganel, \"we ought not to neglect\nit. If I am right that this bottle reached the sea by following the\ncurrent of a river, we cannot fail to come upon the traces of the\nprisoners. Look, my friends, look at the map of this country, and I\nwill convince you beyond a doubt.\"\n\n[Sidenote: NIL DESPERANDUM!]\n\nSo saying, Paganel spread out before them upon the table a large map of\nChili and the Argentine Provinces. \"Look,\" said he, \"and follow me in\nthis passage across the American continent. Let us pass over the narrow\nstrip of Chili and the Cordilleras of the Andes, and descend into the\nmidst of the Pampas. Are rivers, streams, water-courses, wanting in\nthese regions? No. Here are the Rio Negro, the Rio Colorado, and their\naffluents, cut by the thirty-seventh parallel, all of which might have\nserved to transport the document. There, perhaps, in the midst of a\ntribe, in the hands of settled Indians, on the shores of these unknown\nrivers, in the gorges of the sierras, those whom I have the right to\ncall our friends are awaiting an interposition of Providence. Ought\nwe, then, to disappoint their hopes? Do you not think we should follow\nacross these countries an unswerving course? And if, contrary to all\nexpectation, I am still mistaken, is it not our duty to trace this\nparallel to the very end, and, if necessary, make upon it the tour of\nthe world?\"\n\nThese words, spoken with a noble enthusiasm, excited a deep emotion\namong Paganel's hearers. All rose to shake hands with him.\n\n\"Yes, my father is there!\" cried Robert Grant, devouring the map with\nhis eyes.\n\n\"And wherever he is,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we shall find him, my child.\nNothing is more consistent than our friend Paganel's interpretation,\nand we must follow without hesitation the course he has indicated.\nEither Captain Grant is in the hands of countless Indians, or is\nprisoner in a feeble tribe. In the latter case, we will rescue him. In\nthe former, after ascertaining his situation, we will join the Duncan\non the eastern coast, sail to Buenos Ayres, and with a detachment,\norganized by the major, can overcome all the Indians of the Argentine\nPlains.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, your lordship,\" answered Captain Mangles; \"and I will add\nthat this passage of the continent will be without peril.\"\n\n\"Without peril, or fatigue,\" continued Paganel. \"How many have already\naccomplished it who had scarcely our means for success, and whose\ncourage was not sustained by the grandeur of the undertaking!\"\n\n\"Sir, sir,\" exclaimed Mary Grant, in a voice broken with emotion, \"how\ncan I thank a devotion that exposes you to so many dangers?\"\n\n\"Dangers!\" cried Paganel. \"Who uttered the word _danger_?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" replied Robert Grant, with flashing eye and determined look.\n\n\"Danger!\" repeated Paganel; \"does such a thing exist? Moreover, what is\nthe question? A journey of scarcely three hundred and fifty leagues,\nsince we shall proceed in a straight line; a journey which will be\naccomplished in a favorable latitude and climate; in short, a journey\nwhose duration will be only a month at most. It is a mere walk.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel,\" asked Lady Helena at last, \"do you think that, if\nthe shipwrecked sailors have fallen into the power of the Indians,\ntheir lives have been spared?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do, madam. The Indians are not cannibals; far from that,\none of my countrymen whom I knew in the Society was three years\nprisoner among the Indians of the Pampas. He suffered, was ill-treated,\nbut at last gained the victory in this trying ordeal. A European is\na useful person in these countries. The Indians know his value, and\nesteem him very highly.\"\n\n\"Well then, there is no more hesitation,\" said Glenarvan; \"we must\nstart, and that, too, without delay. What course shall we take?\"\n\n\"An easy and agreeable one,\" replied Paganel. \"A few mountains to begin\nwith; then a gentle descent on the eastern slope of the Andes; and at\nlast a level, grassy, sandy plain, a real garden.\"\n\n\"Let us see the map,\" said the major.\n\n\"Here it is, my dear MacNabb. We shall begin at the end of the\nthirty-seventh parallel on the coast of Chili. After passing through\nthe capital of Araucania, we shall strike the Cordilleras, and\ndescending their steep declivities across the Rio Colorado, we shall\nreach the Pampas. Passing the frontiers of Buenos Ayres, we shall\ncontinue our search until we reach the shores of the Atlantic.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A STROLL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.]\n\nThus speaking and developing the programme of the expedition, Paganel\ndid not even take the trouble to look at the map spread before him.\nAnd he had no need to; educated in the schools of Fr\u00e9zier, Molina,\nHumboldt, and Miers, his unerring memory could neither be deceived nor\nbaffled. After finishing his plan, he added:\n\n\"Therefore, my dear friends, the course is straight. In thirty days we\nshall accomplish it, and arrive before the Duncan on the eastern shore,\nsince the westerly winds will delay her progress.\"\n\n\"The Duncan then,\" said Captain Mangles, \"will cross the thirty-seventh\nparallel between Cape Corrientes and Cape St. Antonio?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And whom would you constitute the members of such an expedition?\"\nasked Glenarvan.\n\n\"The fewer the better. The only point is to ascertain the situation of\nCaptain Grant, and not to engage in combat with the Indians. I think\nthat Lord Glenarvan, as our chief, the major, who would yield his place\nto no one, your servant Jacques Paganel----\"\n\n\"And I!\" cried Robert Grant.\n\n\"Robert?\" said Mary.\n\n\"And why not?\" answered Paganel. \"Travels develop youth. We four, then,\nand three sailors of the Duncan----\"\n\n\"What,\" exclaimed Captain Mangles, \"your lordship does not intercede\nfor me?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we shall leave the ladies on\nboard, the dearest objects we have in the world. Who would watch over\nthem, if not the devoted captain of the Duncan?\"\n\n\"We cannot accompany you, then,\" said Lady Helena, whose eyes were\ndimmed by a mist of sadness.\n\n\"My dear wife,\" replied Glenarvan, \"our journey will be performed with\nunusual rapidity, our separation will be short, and----\"\n\n[Illustration: The mate, Tom Austin, Wilson, a powerful fellow, and\nMulready, were the fortunate ones.]\n\n[Sidenote: GOOD AFTERNOON!]\n\n\"Yes, yes; I understand you,\" answered Lady Helena. \"Go, then, and may\nyou succeed in your enterprise.\"\n\n\"Besides, this is not a journey,\" added Paganel.\n\n\"What is it, then?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"A passage, nothing more. We shall pass, that is all, like honest\nmen, over the country and do all the good possible. '_Transire\nbenefaciendo_' is our motto.\"\n\nWith these words the discussion ended. The preparations were begun that\nvery day, and it was resolved to keep the expedition secret, in order\nnot to alarm the Indians. The 14th of October was fixed for the day of\ndeparture.\n\nWhen they came to choose the sailors who were to go, they all offered\ntheir services, and Glenarvan was forced to make a choice. He preferred\nto have them draw lots, that he might not mortify such brave men. This\nwas accordingly done; and the mate, Tom Austin, Wilson, a powerful\nfellow, and Mulready, were the fortunate ones.\n\nLord Glenarvan had displayed great energy in his preparations, for he\nwished to be ready at the day appointed; and he was. Captain Mangles\nlikewise supplied his ship with coal, that he might put to sea at any\nmoment. He wished to gain the Argentine shore before the travelers.\nHence there was a real rivalry between Glenarvan and the captain, which\nwas of advantage to both.", "At last, on the 14th of October, at the time agreed upon, every one was\nready. At the moment of departure the passengers of the yacht assembled\nin the cabin. The Duncan was on the point of starting, and already her\npropeller was agitating the quiet waters of Talcahuana Bay. Glenarvan,\nPaganel, MacNabb, Robert Grant, Tom Austin, Wilson and Mulready, armed\nwith carbines and Colt's revolvers, were preparing to leave the vessel.\nGuides and mules were waiting for them on shore.\n\n\"It is time,\" said Lord Glenarvan at last.\n\n\"Go, then, my husband!\" replied Lady Helena, restraining her emotion.\n\nHe pressed her to his breast, while Robert threw himself upon the neck\nof his sister.\n\n\"And now, dear companions,\" said Jacques Paganel, \"one last clasp of\nthe hand to last us till we reach the shores of the Atlantic.\"\n\nIt was not asking much, but these were clasps which would strengthen\nthe hopes of the worthy geographer.\n\nThey then returned to the deck, and the seven travelers left the\nvessel. They soon reached the wharf, which the yacht approached within\nless than half a cable's length.\n\nLady Helena cried for the last time,--\n\n\"My friends, God help you!\"\n\n\"And he will help us, madam,\" answered Jacques Paganel; \"for, I assure\nyou, we shall help ourselves.\"\n\n\"Forward!\" shouted Captain Mangles to his engineer.\n\n\"_En route_!\" returned Glenarvan; and at the same instant that the\ntravelers, giving reins to their animals, followed the road along the\nshore, the Duncan started again at full speed on the highway of the\nocean.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTRAVELING IN CHILI.\n\n\nThe native troop engaged by Glenarvan consisted of three men and a boy.\nThe leader of the muleteers was an Englishman who had lived in the\ncountry for twenty years. His occupation was to let mules to travelers,\nand guide them across the passes of the Andes. Then he consigned them\nto the care of a \"laqueano\" (Argentine guide), who was familiar with\nthe road over the Pampas.\n\n[Sidenote: THE PROCESSION FORMED.]\n\nThis Englishman had not so forgotten his native tongue, in the company\nof mules and Indians, that he could not converse with the travelers.\nHence it was easy for Glenarvan to make known his wishes, and for\nthe muleteer to execute his orders, of which circumstance the former\navailed himself, since Paganel had not yet succeeded in making himself\nunderstood.\n\nThis leader, or \"catapaz,\" in the language of Chili, was assisted by\ntwo native peons and a boy of twelve. The peons had charge of the\nmules laden with the baggage of the party, and the boy led the madrina\n(little mare), which wore small bells, and went in advance of the other\nten mules. The travelers were mounted on seven, and the catapaz on one,\nof these animals, while the two others carried the provisions and a\nfew rolls of cloth designed to insure the good-will of the chiefs of\nthe plains. The peons traveled on foot according to their custom. This\njourney in South America was, therefore, to be performed under the most\nfavorable conditions of safety and speed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCrossing the Andes is not an ordinary journey. It cannot be undertaken\nwithout employing those hardy mules, of which the most preferable\nbelong to the Argentine Republic. These excellent animals have attained\nin that country a development superior to their pristine quality and\nstrength. They are not very particular about their food, drink only\nonce a day, and easily make ten leagues in eight hours.\n\nThere are no taverns on this route, from one ocean to the other. You\neat dried meat, rice seasoned with allspice, and whatever game can be\ncaptured on the way. In the mountains the torrents, and in the plains\nthe rivers, furnish water, generally flavored with a few drops of rum,\nof which each has a supply in an ox-horn called \"chiffle.\" However,\ncare must be taken not to indulge too much in alcoholic drinks, which\nare specially injurious in a region where the nervous system is\npeculiarly excited.\n\nAs for your bedding, it consists merely of the native saddle called\n\"recado.\" This saddle is made of sheep-skins tanned on one side and\ncovered with wool on the other, and is supported by broad girths\nelaborately embroidered. A traveler wrapped in one of these warm\ncoverings can brave with impunity the dampness of the nights, and enjoy\nthe soundest repose.\n\nGlenarvan, who knew how to travel and conform to the customs of\ndifferent countries, had adopted the Chilian costume for himself and\nhis friends. Paganel and Robert, two children (a large and a small\none), felt no pleasure in introducing their heads into the national\nponcho (a large blanket with a hole in the centre), and their legs\ninto leathern stirrups. They would rather have seen their mules\nrichly caparisoned, with the Arab bit in their mouths, a long bridle\nof braided leather for a whip, and their heads adorned with metal\nornaments and the \"alforjas\" (double saddle-bags containing the\nprovisions).\n\n[Sidenote: LAND AND WATER.]\n\nPaganel, always absent-minded, received three or four kicks from his\nexcellent animal just as he was mounting. Once in the saddle, however,\nwith his inseparable telescope in a sling and his feet confined in the\nstirrups, he confided himself to the sagacity of his beast, and had\nno reason to repent. As for young Robert, he showed from the first a\nremarkable capacity for becoming an excellent horseman.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey started. The day was magnificent, the sky was perfectly clear,\nand the atmosphere sufficiently refreshed by the sea-breezes in spite\nof the heat of the sun. The little party followed at a rapid pace the\nwinding shores of the bay, and made good progress the first day across\nthe reeds of old dried marshes. Little was said. The parting farewells\nhad left a deep impression upon the minds of all. They could still see\nthe smoke of the Duncan as she gradually disappeared on the horizon.\nAll were silent, except Paganel; this studious geographer kept asking\nhimself questions, and answering them, in his new language.\n\nThe catapaz was, moreover, quite a taciturn man, whose avocation had\nnot made him loquacious. He scarcely spoke to his peons, for they\nunderstood their duty very well. Whenever a mule stopped, they urged\nhim with a guttural cry. If this did not suffice, a good pebble thrown\nwith sure aim overcame his obstinacy. If a girth gave way or a bridle\nwas loosened, the peon, taking off his poncho, enveloped the head of\nthe animal, which, when the injury was repaired, resumed its pace.\n\nThe custom of the muleteers is to set out at eight o'clock in the\nmorning after breakfast, and travel thus till it is time to rest at\nfour o'clock in the afternoon. Glenarvan, accordingly, conformed\nto this custom. Precisely when the signal to halt was given by the\ncatapaz, the travelers arrived at the city of Arauco, situated at the\nsouthern extremity of the bay, without having left the foam-washed\nshore of the ocean. They would have had to proceed twenty miles farther\nto the west to reach the limits of the thirty-seventh parallel; but\nGlenarvan's agents had already traversed that part of the coast\nwithout meeting with any signs of shipwreck. A new exploration became,\ntherefore, useless, and it was decided that the city of Arauco should\nbe chosen as their point of departure. From this their course was to\nbe directed towards the east in a rigorously straight line. The little\nparty entered the city and took up their quarters in the open court of\na tavern, whose accommodations were still in a rudimentary state.\n\nWhile supper was preparing, Glenarvan, Paganel and the catapaz took a\nwalk among the thatch-roofed houses. Except a church and the remains\nof a convent of Franciscans, Arauco presented nothing interesting.\nGlenarvan attempted to make some inquiries, but failed, while Paganel\nwas in despair at not being able to make himself understood by the\ninhabitants. But, since they spoke Araucanian, his Spanish served him\nas little as Hebrew.\n\n[Sidenote: ONWARD, AND ONWARD STILL.]\n\nThe next day, the madrina at the head, and the peons in the rear, the\nlittle troop resumed the line of the thirty-seventh parallel towards\nthe east. They now crossed the fertile territory of Araucania, rich in\nvineyards and flocks. But gradually solitude ensued. Scarcely, from\nmile to mile, was there a hut of \"rastreadores\" (Indian horse-tamers).\nNow and then they came upon an abandoned relay-station, that only\nserved as a shelter to some wanderer on the plains; and, by means of a\nford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the mountains visible in the distance.\n\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon, after a journey of thirty-five miles,\nthey halted in the open country under a group of giant myrtles. The\nmules were unharnessed, and left to graze at will upon the rich herbage\nof the prairie. The saddle-bags furnished the usual meat and rice,\nthe pelions spread on the ground served as covering, the saddles as\npillows, and each one found on these improvised beds a ready repose,\nwhile the peons and the catapaz watched in turn.\n\nAs the weather continued pleasant, all the travelers, not excepting\nRobert, were still in good health; and, since the journey had begun\nunder such favorable auspices, they thought it best to profit by it,\nand push on. The following day they advanced rapidly, crossed without\naccident Bell Rapids, and at evening encamped on the banks of the Rio\nBiobio. There were thirty-five miles more to travel before they were\nout of Chili.\n\nThe country had not changed. It was still rich in amaryllis, violets,\ndate-trees, and golden-flowered cactuses. A few animals, among\nothers the ocelot, inhabited the thickets. A heron, a solitary owl,\nthrushes and snipes wary of the talons of the hawk, were the only\nrepresentatives of the feathered tribe.", "Of the natives few were seen; only some \"guassos\" (degenerate children\nof the Indians and Spanish), galloping on horses which they lacerated\nwith the gigantic spurs that adorned their naked feet, and passing\nlike shadows. They met on the way no one who could inform them, and\ninquiries were therefore utterly impossible.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ASTONISHED CATAPAZ.]\n\nGlenarvan thought that Captain Grant, if prisoner of the Indians, must\nhave been carried by them beyond the Andes. Their search could be\nsuccessful only in the Pampas. They must be patient, and travel on\nswiftly and continuously.\n\n[Illustration: By means of a ford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the\nmountains visible in the distance.]\n\nThey advanced in the same order as before, which Robert with difficulty\nkept, for his eagerness led him to press forward, to the great\nannoyance of his animal. Nothing but a command from Glenarvan would\nkeep the young boy at his place in the line. The country now became\nmore uneven; and several hillocks indicated that they were approaching\nthe mountains.\n\nPaganel still continued his study of Spanish.\n\n\"What a language it is!\" exclaimed he; \"so full and sonorous!\"\n\n\"But you are making progress, of course?\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"Certainly, my dear lord. Ah! if there were only no accent! But, alas!\nthere is one!\"\n\nIn studying this language, Paganel did not, however, neglect his\ngeographical observations. In these, indeed, he was astonishingly\nclever, and could not have found his superior. When Glenarvan\nquestioned the catapaz about some peculiarity of the country, his\nlearned companion would always anticipate the answer of the guide, who\nthen gazed at him with a look of amazement.\n\nThat same day they met a road which crossed the line that they had\nhitherto pursued. Lord Glenarvan naturally asked its name of their\nguide, and Paganel as naturally answered,--\n\n\"The road from Yumbel to Los Angelos.\"\n\nGlenarvan looked at the catapaz.\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied he.\n\nThen, addressing the geographer, he said,--\n\n\"You have traveled in this country?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Paganel gravely.\n\n\"On a mule?\"\n\n\"No; in an arm-chair.\"\n\nThe catapaz did not understand, for he shrugged his shoulders and\nreturned to the head of the troop.\n\nAt five o'clock in the afternoon they stopped in a shallow gorge, a\nfew miles above the little town of Loja; and that night the travelers\nencamped at the foot of the first slopes of the Andes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ALOFT.\n\n\nThe route through Chili had as yet presented no serious obstacles; but\nnow the dangers that attend a journey across the mountains suddenly\nincreased, the struggle with the natural difficulties was about to\nbegin in earnest.\n\nAn important question had to be decided before starting. By what pass\ncould they cross the Andes with the least departure from the prescribed\ncourse? The catapaz was questioned on this subject.\n\n\"I know,\" he replied, \"of but two passes that are practicable in this\npart of the Andes.\"\n\n\"Doubtless the pass of Arica,\" said Paganel, \"which was discovered by\nValdivia Mendoza.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And that of Villarica, situated to the south of Nevado.\"\n\n\"You are right.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, these two passes have only one difficulty; they will\ncarry us to the south, or the north, farther than we wish.\"\n\n\"Have you another pass to propose?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Paganel; \"the pass of Antuco.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Glenarvan; \"but do you know this pass, catapaz?\"\n\n[Sidenote: ATTAINING TO EMINENCE.]\n\n\"Yes, my lord, I have crossed it, and did not propose it because it is\nonly a cattle-track for the Indian herdsmen of the eastern slopes.\"\n\n\"Never mind, my friend,\" continued Glenarvan; \"where the herds of the\nIndians pass, we can also; and, since this will keep us in our course,\nlet us start for the pass of Antuco.\"\n\nThe signal for departure was immediately given, and they entered the\nvalley of Los Lejos between great masses of crystalized limestone, and\nascended a very gradual slope. Towards noon they had to pass around\nthe shores of a small lake, the picturesque reservoir of all the\nneighboring streams which flowed into it.\n\nAbove the lake extended vast \"llanos,\" lofty plains, covered with\ngrass, where the herds of the Indians grazed. Then they came upon a\nswamp which extended to the south and north, but which the instinct\nof the mules enabled them to avoid. Soon Fort Ballenare appeared on a\nrocky peak which it crowned with its dismantled walls. The ascent had\nalready become abrupt and stony, and the pebbles, loosened by the hoofs\nof the mules, rolled under their feet in a rattling torrent.\n\nThe road now became difficult, and even perilous. The steepness\nincreased, the walls on either side approached each other more and\nmore, while the precipices yawned frightfully. The mules advanced\ncautiously in single file, with their noses to the ground, scenting the\nway.\n\nNow and then, at a sudden turn, the madrina disappeared, and the little\ncaravan was then guided by the distant tinkling of her bell. Sometimes,\ntoo, the capricious windings of the path would bend the column into\ntwo parallel lines, and the catapaz could talk to the peons, while a\ncrevasse, scarcely two fathoms wide, but two hundred deep, formed an\nimpassable abyss between them.\n\nUnder these conditions it was difficult to distinguish the course. The\nalmost incessant action of subterranean and volcanic agency changes\nthe road, and the landmarks are never the same. Therefore the catapaz\nhesitated, stopped, looked about him, examined the form of the rocks,\nand searched on the crumbling stones for the tracks of Indians.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGlenarvan followed in the steps of his guide. He perceived, he _felt_,\nhis embarrassment, increasing with the difficulties of the way. He did\nnot dare to question him, but thought that it was better to trust to\nthe instinct of the muleteers and mules.\n\nFor an hour longer the catapaz wandered at a venture, but always\nseeking the more elevated parts of the mountain. At last he was forced\nto stop short. They were at the bottom of a narrow valley,--one of\nthose ravines that the Indians call \"quebradas.\" A perpendicular wall\nof porphyry barred their exit.\n\n[Sidenote: CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN.]\n\nThe catapaz, after searching vainly for a passage, dismounted, folded\nhis arms, and waited. Glenarvan approached him.\n\n\"Have you lost your way?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied the catapaz.\n\n\"But we are not at the pass of Antuco?\"\n\n\"We are.\"\n\n\"Are you not mistaken?\"\n\n\"I am not. Here are the remains of a fire made by the Indians, and the\ntracks left by their horses.\"\n\n\"Well, they passed this way?\"\n\n\"Yes; but we cannot. The last earthquake has made it impracticable.\"\n\n\"For mules,\" replied the major; \"but not for men.\"\n\n\"That is for you to decide,\" said the catapaz. \"I have done what I\ncould. My mules and I are ready to turn back, if you please, and search\nfor the other passes of the Andes.\"\n\n\"But that will cause a delay.\"\n\n\"Of three days, at least.\"\n\nGlenarvan listened in silence to the words of the catapaz, who had\nevidently acted in accordance with his engagement. His mules could go\nno farther; but when the proposal was made to retrace their steps,\nGlenarvan turned towards his companions, and said,--\n\n\"Do you wish to go on?\"\n\n\"We will follow you,\" replied Tom Austin.\n\n\"And even precede you,\" added Paganel. \"What is it, after all? To scale\na chain of mountains whose opposite slopes afford an unusually easy\ndescent. This accomplished, we can find the Argentine laqueanos, who\nwill guide us across the Pampas, and swift horses accustomed to travel\nover the plains. Forward, then, without hesitation.\"\n\n\"Forward!\" cried his companions.\n\n\"You do not accompany us?\" said Glenarvan to the catapaz.\n\n\"I am the muleteer,\" he replied.\n\n\"As you say.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Paganel; \"on the other side of this wall we shall\nfind the pass of Antuco again, and I will lead you to the foot of the\nmountain as directly as the best guide of the Andes.\"\n\nGlenarvan accordingly settled with the catapaz, and dismissed him, his\npeons, and his mules. The arms, the instruments, and the remaining\nprovisions, were divided among the seven travelers. By common consent\nit was decided that the ascent should be undertaken immediately, and\nthat, if necessary, they should travel part of the night. Around the\nprecipice to the left wound a steep path that mules could not ascend.\nThe difficulties were great; but, after two hours of fatigue and\nwandering, Glenarvan and his companions found themselves again in the\npass of Antuco.\n\nThey were now in that part of the Andes properly so called, not far\nfrom the main ridge of the mountains; but of the path traced out, of\nthe pass, nothing could be seen. All this region had just been thrown\ninto confusion by the recent earthquakes.\n\nThey ascended all night, climbed almost inaccessible plateaus, and\nleaped over broad and deep crevasses. Their arms took the place of\nropes, and their shoulders served as steps. The strength of Mulready\nand the skill of Wilson were often called into requisition. Many times,\nwithout their devotion and courage, the little party could not have\nadvanced.\n\nGlenarvan never lost sight of young Robert, whose youth and eagerness\nled him to acts of rashness, while Paganel pressed on with all the\nardor of a Frenchman. As for the major, he only moved as much as\nwas necessary, no more, no less, and mounted the path by an almost\ninsensible motion. Did he perceive that he had been ascending\nfor several hours? It is not certain. Perhaps he imagined he was\ndescending.\n\n[Sidenote: PRACTICING \"EXCELSIOR.\"]\n\nAt five o'clock in the morning the travelers had attained a height of\nseven thousand five hundred feet. They were now on the lower ridges,\nthe last limit of arborescent vegetation. At this hour the aspect of\nthese regions was entirely changed. Great blocks of glittering ice, of\na bluish color in certain parts, rose on all sides, and reflected the\nfirst rays of the sun.\n\n[Illustration]", "[Illustration]\n\nThe ascent now became very perilous. They no longer advanced without\ncarefully examining the ice. Wilson had taken the lead, and with his\nfoot tested the surface of the glaciers. His companions followed\nexactly in his footsteps, and avoided uttering a word, for the least\nsound might have caused the fall of the snowy masses suspended eight\nhundred feet above their heads.\n\nThey had reached the region of shrubs, which, four hundred and fifty\nfeet higher, gave place to grass and cactuses. At eleven thousand feet\nall traces of vegetation disappeared. The travelers had stopped only\nonce to recruit their strength by a hasty repast, and with superhuman\ncourage they resumed the ascent in the face of the ever-increasing\ndangers.\n\n[Illustration: Two hours more of terrible exertion followed. They kept\nascending, in order to reach the highest summit of this part of the\nmountain.]\n\n[Sidenote: SOMEWHAT SERIOUS.]\n\nThe strength of the little troop, however, in spite of their courage,\nwas almost gone. Glenarvan, seeing the exhaustion of his companions,\nregretted having engaged in the undertaking. Young Robert struggled\nagainst fatigue, but could go no farther.\n\nGlenarvan stopped.\n\n\"We must take a rest,\" said he, for he clearly saw that no one else\nwould make this proposal.\n\n\"Take a rest?\" replied Paganel; \"how? where? we have no shelter.\"\n\n\"It is indispensable, if only for Robert.\"\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied the courageous child; \"I can still walk--do not\nstop.\"\n\n\"We will carry you, my boy,\" said Paganel, \"but we must, at all\nhazards, reach the eastern slope. There, perhaps, we shall find some\nhut in which we can take refuge. I ask for two hours more of travel.\"\n\n\"Do you all agree?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied his companions.\n\n\"I will take charge of the brave boy,\" added the equally brave Mulready.\n\nThey resumed their march towards the east. Two hours more of terrible\nexertion followed. They kept ascending, in order to reach the highest\nsummit of this part of the mountain.\n\nWhatever were the desires of these courageous men, the moment now came\nwhen the most valiant failed, and dizziness, that terrible malady of\nthe mountains, exhausted not only their physical strength but their\nmoral courage. It is impossible to struggle with impunity against\nfatigues of this kind. Soon falls became frequent, and those who fell\ncould only advance by dragging themselves on their knees.\n\nExhaustion was about to put an end to this too prolonged ascent; and\nGlenarvan was considering with terror the extent of the snow, the cold\nwhich in this fatal region was so much to be dreaded, the shadows that\nwere deepening on the solitary peaks, and the absence of a shelter for\nthe night, when the major stopped him, and, in a calm tone, said,--\n\n\"A hut!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nA SUDDEN DESCENT.\n\n\nAny one but MacNabb would have passed by, around, or even over this\nhut a hundred times without suspecting its existence. A projection on\nthe surface of the snow scarcely distinguished it from the surrounding\nrocks. It was necessary to uncover it; after half an hour of persistent\nlabor, Wilson and Mulready had cleared away the entrance to the\n\"casucha,\" and the little party stepped in.\n\n[Sidenote: A \"RESTAURANT\" REOPENED.]\n\nThis casucha, constructed by the Indians, was made of adobes, a kind\nof bricks dried in the sun. Ten persons could easily find room inside,\nand, if its walls had not been sufficiently water-tight in the rainy\nseason, at this time, at least, they were some protection against the\nseverity of the cold. There was, besides, a sort of fireplace with a\nflue of bricks very poorly laid, which enabled them to kindle a fire,\nand thus withstand the external temperature.\n\n\"Here is a shelter, at least,\" said Glenarvan, \"even if it is not\ncomfortable. Providence has led us hither, and we cannot do better than\naccept this fortune.\"\n\n\"Why,\" replied Paganel, \"it is a palace. It only wants sentries and\ncourtiers. We shall get along admirably here.\"\n\n\"Especially when a good fire is blazing on the hearth,\" said Tom\nAustin; \"for, if we are hungry, we are none the less cold it seems to\nme; and, for my part, a good fagot would delight me more than a slice\nof venison.\"\n\n\"Well, Tom,\" said Paganel, \"we will try to find something combustible.\"\n\n\"Something combustible on the top of the Andes?\" said Mulready, shaking\nhis head doubtfully.\n\n\"Since a chimney has been made in this hut,\" replied the major, \"there\nis probably something here to burn.\"\n\n\"Our friend is right,\" added Glenarvan. \"Prepare everything for supper;\nand I will play the part of wood-cutter.\"\n\n\"I will accompany you with Wilson,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"If you need me----,\" said Robert, rising.\n\n\"No, rest yourself, my brave boy,\" replied Glenarvan. \"You will be a\nman when others are only children.\"\n\nGlenarvan, Paganel, and Wilson went out of the hut. It was six o'clock\nin the evening. The cold was keen and cutting, in spite of the calmness\nof the air. The azure of the sky was already fading, and the sun\nshedding his last rays on the lofty peaks of the mountains.\n\nReaching a hillock of porphyry, they scanned the horizon in every\ndirection. They had now gained the summit of the Andes, which commanded\nan extended prospect. To the east the sides of the mountains declined\nby gentle gradations, down which they could see the peons sliding\nseveral hundred feet below. In the distance extended long lines of\nscattered rocks and stones that had been crowded back by glacial\navalanches. The valley of the Colorado was already growing dim in the\nincreasing twilight; the elevations of land, the crags and the peaks,\nillumined by the rays of the sun, gradually faded, and darkness covered\nthe whole eastern slope of the Andes.\n\nTowards the north undulated a succession of ridges that mingled\ntogether insensibly. To the south, however, the view was magnificent;\nand, as night descended, the grandeur was inimitable. Looking down\ninto the wild valley of Torbido, you saw Mount Antuco, whose yawning\ncrater was two miles distant. The volcano, like some enormous monster,\nbelched forth glowing smoke mingled with torrents of bright flame. The\ncircle of the mountains that inclosed it seemed to be on fire. Showers\nof incandescent stones, clouds of reddish vapors, and streams of lava,\nunited in glittering columns. A loud rumbling that increased every\nmoment, and was followed by a dazzling flash, filled this vast circuit\nwith its sharp reverberations, while the sun, his light gradually\nfading, disappeared as a star is extinguished in the shadows of the\nhorizon.\n\n[Sidenote: FOOD BROUGHT TO THE DOOR.]\n\nPaganel and Glenarvan would have remained a long time to contemplate\nthis magnificent struggle of the fires of earth with those of heaven,\nand the improvised wood-cutters were becoming admirers of nature; but\nWilson, less enthusiastic, reminded them of their situation. Wood was\nwanting, it is true, but fortunately a scanty and dry moss clothed the\nrocks. An ample supply was taken, as well as of a plant whose roots\nwere quite combustible. This precious fuel was brought to the hut, and\npiled in the fire-place; but it was difficult to kindle the fire, and\nespecially to keep it burning.\n\nWhen the viands were prepared, each one drank several mouthfuls of\nhot coffee with delight. As for the dried meat, it appeared a little\nunsatisfactory, which provoked on the part of Paganel a remark as\nuseless as it was true.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said he, \"I must confess a llama-steak would not be bad just\nnow.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the major, \"are you not content with our supper, Paganel?\"\n\n\"Enchanted, my good major; but I acknowledge a plate of venison would\nbe welcome.\"\n\n\"You are a sybarite,\" said MacNabb.\n\n\"I accept the title, major; but you yourself, whatever you may say,\nwould not be displeased with a beefsteak.\"\n\n\"Probably not.\"\n\n\"And if you were asked to take your post at the cannon, you would go\nwithout a word.\"\n\n\"Certainly: and, although it pleases you----\"\n\nHis companions had not heard any more, when distant and prolonged howls\nwere heard. They were not the cries of scattered animals, but those of\na herd approaching with rapidity. Would Providence, after furnishing\nthem with shelter, give them their supper? Such was the thought of the\ngeographer. But Glenarvan humbled his joy somewhat by observing that\nthe animals of the Andes were never met with in so elevated a region.\n\n\"Whence comes the noise, then?\" asked Tom Austin. \"Hear how it\napproaches!\"\n\n\"An avalanche!\" said Mulready.\n\n\"Impossible! these are real howls!\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Let us see,\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Let us see like hunters,\" answered the major, as he took his rifle.\n\nAll rushed out of the hut. Night had come. It was dark, but the sky was\nstudded with stars. The moon had not yet shown her disk. The peaks\non the north and east were lost in the darkness, and the eye only\nperceived the grotesque outlines of a few towering rocks.\n\nThe howls--those of terrified animals--were redoubled. They came from\nthe dark side of the mountain. What was going on?\n\nSuddenly there came a furious avalanche, but one of living creatures,\nmad with terror. The whole plateau seemed to tremble. There were\nhundreds, perhaps thousands, of these animals. Were they wild beasts\nof the Pampas, or only llamas? The whole party had only time to throw\nthemselves to the earth, while this living whirlwind passed a few feet\nabove them.\n\nAt this moment the report of a fire-arm was heard. The major had shot\nat a venture. He thought that a large animal fell a few paces from\nhim, while the whole herd, carried along by their resistless motion,\ndisappeared down the slopes illumined by the volcano.\n\n\"Ah, I have them!\" cried a voice, that of Paganel.\n\n\"What have you?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"My glasses, to be sure!\"\n\n\"You are not wounded?\"\n\n\"No, a little kick,--but by what?\"\n\n\"By this,\" replied the major, dragging after him the animal he had shot.", "\"What have you?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"My glasses, to be sure!\"\n\n\"You are not wounded?\"\n\n\"No, a little kick,--but by what?\"\n\n\"By this,\" replied the major, dragging after him the animal he had shot.\n\nEach one hastened to gain the hut; and by the light of the fire\nMacNabb's prize was examined. It was a pretty animal, resembling a\nlittle camel without a hump. It had a small head, flat body, long legs\nand claws, fine coffee-colored hair, and its breast was spotted with\nwhite.\n\nScarcely had Paganel looked at it when he exclaimed,--\n\n\"It is a guanaco!\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"An animal that eats itself.\"\n\n\"And is it good?\"\n\n[Sidenote: \"A DISH FOR THE GODS.\"]\n\n\"Delicious! a dish for the gods! I knew well that you would like fresh\nmeat for supper. And what meat this is! But who will dress the animal?\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"Well, I will engage to broil it,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"You are a cook, then, Monsieur Paganel?\" said Robert.\n\n\"Certainly, my boy. A Frenchman is always a cook.\"\n\nIn a little while Paganel placed large slices of meat on the coals,\nand, in a short time, served up to his companions this appetizing\nviand. No one hesitated, but each attacked it ravenously. To the great\namazement of the geographer, a general grimace accompanied by a \"pwah!\"\nfollowed the first mouthful.\n\n\"It is horrible!\" said one.\n\n\"It is not eatable!\" replied another.\n\nThe poor geographer, whatever was the difficulty, was forced to agree\nthat this steak was not acceptable even to starving men. They therefore\nbegan to launch jokes at him, and deride his \"dish for the gods,\" while\nhe himself sought a reason for this unaccountable result.\n\n\"I have it!\" he cried. \"I have it!\"\n\n\"Is the meat too old?\" asked MacNabb, calmly.\n\n\"No, my intolerant major; but it has traveled too much. How could I\nforget that?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Tom Austin.\n\n\"I mean that the animal is not good unless killed when at rest. I\ncan affirm from the taste that it has come from a distance, and,\nconsequently, the whole herd.\"\n\n\"You are certain of this?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Absolutely so.\"\n\n\"But what event could have terrified these animals so, and driven them\nat a time when they ought to be peacefully sleeping in their lairs.\"\n\n\"As to that, my dear Glenarvan,\" said Paganel, \"it is impossible for me\nto say. If you believe me, let us search no farther. For my part I am\ndying for want of sleep. Let us retire, major!\"\n\n\"Very well, Paganel.\"\n\nThereupon each wrapped himself in his poncho, the fuel was replenished\nfor the night, and soon all but Glenarvan were buried in profound\nrepose.\n\nHe alone did not sleep. A secret uneasiness held him in a state of\nwakeful fatigue. He could not help thinking of that herd, flying in one\ncommon direction, of their inexplicable terror. They could not have\nbeen pursued by wild beasts: at that height there were scarcely any,\nand yet fewer hunters. What fright had driven them over the abysses\nof Antuco, and what was the cause of it? He thought of their strange\nsituation, and felt a presentiment of coming danger.\n\nHowever, under the influence of a partial drowsiness, his ideas\ngradually modified, and fear gave place to hope. He saw himself in\nanticipation, on the morrow, on the plain at the foot of the Andes.\nThere his actual search was to begin; and success was not, perhaps, far\ndistant. He thought of Captain Grant and his two sailors, delivered\nfrom a cruel slavery.\n\nThese images passed rapidly before his mind, every instant interrupted\nby a flash of fire, a spark, a flame, illumining the faces of his\nsleeping companions, and casting a flickering shadow over the walls of\nthe hut. Then his presentiments returned with more vividness, while\nhe listened vaguely to the external sounds so difficult to explain on\nthese solitary summits.\n\nAt one moment he thought he heard distant rumblings, dull and\nthreatening like the rollings of thunder. These sounds could be caused\nonly by a tempest, raging on the sides of the mountain. He wished to\nconvince himself, and left the hut.\n\nThe moon had risen, and the sky was clear and calm. Not a cloud was to\nbe seen either above or below, only now and then the moving shadows of\nthe flames of the volcano. At the zenith twinkled thousands of stars,\nwhile the rumblings still continued. They seemed to approach, and run\nalong the chain of the mountains.\n\n[Illustration: The internal rumblings, the din of the avalanche, the\ncrash of the blocks of granite, and the whirlwinds of snow, rendered\nall communication with each other impossible.]\n\nGlenarvan returned more uneasy than before, seeking to divine what\nrelation there was between these subterranean noises and the flight of\nthe guanacos. He looked at his watch; it was two o'clock.\n\nHowever, having no certain knowledge of immediate danger, he did not\nwake his companions, whom fatigue held in a deep repose, but fell\nhimself into a heavy sleep that lasted several hours.\n\nAll at once a violent crash startled him to his feet. It was a\ndeafening roar, like the irregular noise of innumerable artillery\nwagons rolling over a hollow pavement. Glenarvan suddenly felt the\nearth tremble beneath his feet. He saw the hut sway and start open.\n\n\"Look out!\" he cried.\n\nHis companions, awakened and thrown into confusion, were hurried down\na rapid descent. The day was breaking, and the scene was terrible. The\nform of the mountains suddenly changed, their tops were truncated,\nthe tottering peaks disappeared, as if a pitfall had opened at their\nbase. A mass, several miles in extent, became detached entire, and slid\ntowards the plain.\n\n\"An earthquake!\" cried Paganel.\n\nHe was not mistaken. It was one of those phenomena frequent on the\nmountain frontier of Chili. This portion of the globe is disturbed\nby subterranean fires, and the volcanoes of this chain afford only\ninsufficient outlets for the confined vapors.\n\nIn the meantime the plateau, to which seven stunned and terrified men\nclung by the tufts of moss, glided with the rapidity of an express.\nNot a cry was possible, not a movement of escape. They could not hear\neach other. The internal rumblings, the din of the avalanche, the crash\nof the blocks of granite, and the whirlwinds of snow, rendered all\ncommunication with each other impossible.\n\n[Sidenote: A STEEP GRADIENT.]\n\nAt one time the mass would slide without jolts or jars; at another,\nseized with a pitching and rolling motion like the deck of a vessel\nshaken by the billows, it would run along the edge of the abysses\ninto which the fragments of the mountain fell, uproot the trees of\ncenturies, and level with the precision of an enormous scythe all the\ninequalities of the eastern slope.\n\nHow long this indescribable scene lasted, no one could tell; in what\nabyss all were to be engulfed, no one was able to foresee. Whether they\nwere all there alive, or whether one of them was lying at the bottom of\na crevasse, no one could say. Stunned by the swiftness of the descent,\nchilled by the keenness of the cold, blinded by the whirlwinds of snow,\nthey panted, exhausted and almost inanimate, and only clung to the\nrocks by the supreme instinct of preservation.\n\nAll at once a shock of unusual violence arrested their gliding vehicle.\nThey were thrown forward and rolled upon the last declivities of the\nmountains. The plateau had stopped short.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFor a few moments no one stirred. At last one rose, deafened by the\nshock, but yet firm. It was the major. He shook off the snow that\nblinded him, and looked around. His companions were not very far from\none another. He counted them. All but one lay on the ground. The\nmissing one was Robert Grant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nPROVIDENTIALLY RESCUED.\n\n\nThe eastern side of the Andes consists of long slopes, declining\ngradually to the plain upon which a portion of the mass had suddenly\nstopped. In this new country, garnished with rich pastures and adorned\nwith magnificent vegetation, an incalculable number of apple-trees,\nplanted at the time of the conquest, glowed with their golden fruit\nand formed true forests. It seemed as if a part of beautiful Normandy\nhad been cast into these monotonous regions, and under any other\ncircumstances the eye of a traveler would have been struck with this\nsudden transition from desert to oasis, from snowy peak to verdant\nprairie, from winter to summer.\n\nThe earth had regained an absolute immobility, and the earthquake had\nceased. But without doubt the subterranean forces were still exerting\ntheir devastating action at a distance, for the chain of the Andes is\nalways agitated or trembling in some part. This time, however, the\ncommotion had been of extreme violence. The outline of the mountains\nwas entirely changed; a new view of summits, crests, and peaks was\ndefined against the azure of the sky; and the guide of the Pampas would\nhave sought in vain for his accustomed landmarks.\n\n[Sidenote: COMEDY CHANGED TO TRAGEDY.]\n\nA wonderfully beautiful day was breaking. The rays of the sun, issuing\nfrom their watery bed in the Atlantic, glittered over the Argentine\nplains and were already silvering the waves of the other ocean. It was\neight o'clock in the morning.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, revived by the aid of the major,\ngradually recovered consciousness. Indeed, they had only undergone\na severe giddiness. The mountain was descended, and they would have\napplauded a means of locomotion which had been entirely at nature's\nexpense, if one of the feeblest, Robert Grant, had not been missing.\nEvery one loved the courageous boy: Paganel was particularly attached\nto him; the major, too, in spite of his coldness; but especially\nGlenarvan.\n\nWhen the latter learned of Robert's disappearance, he was desperate. He\npictured to himself the poor child engulfed in some abyss, and calling\nvainly for him whom he considered his second father.", "When the latter learned of Robert's disappearance, he was desperate. He\npictured to himself the poor child engulfed in some abyss, and calling\nvainly for him whom he considered his second father.\n\n\"My friends,\" said he, scarcely restraining his tears, \"we must search\nfor him, we must find him! We cannot abandon him thus! Every valley,\nevery precipice, every abyss must be explored to the very bottom! You\nshall tie a rope around me and let me down! I will do it, you hear me,\nI will! May Heaven grant that Robert is still living! Without him,\nhow could we dare find his father? What right have we to save Captain\nGrant, if his rescue costs the life of his child?\"\n\nHis companions listened without speaking. They felt that he was seeking\nin their looks some ray of hope, and they lowered their eyes.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"you understand me; you are silent! You\nhave no more hope!\"\n\nA few moments of silence ensued, when MacNabb inquired:\n\n\"Who of you, my friends, remembers when Robert disappeared?\"\n\nTo this question no answer was given.\n\n\"At least,\" continued the major, \"you can tell with whom the boy was\nduring the descent.\"\n\n\"With me,\" replied Wilson.\n\n\"Well, at what moment did you last see him with you? Recall the\ncircumstances. Speak.\"\n\n\"This is all that I remember. Robert Grant was at my side, his hand\ngrasping a tuft of moss, less than two minutes before the shock that\ncaused our descent.\"\n\n\"Less than two minutes? Remember, Wilson, the minutes may have seemed\nlong to you. Are you not mistaken?\"\n\n\"I think not--yes, it is so, less than two minutes.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said MacNabb; \"and was Robert on your right, or on your left?\"\n\n\"On my left. I remember that his poncho flapped in my face.\"\n\n\"And where were you situated in reference to us?\"\n\n\"On the left also.\"\n\n\"Then Robert could have disappeared only on this side,\" said the major,\nturning towards the mountain, and pointing to the right. \"And also\nconsidering the time that has elapsed since his disappearance, the\nchild must have fallen at a high part of the mountain. There we must\nsearch, and, by taking different ways, we shall find him.\"\n\nNot a word more was said. The six men, scaling the declivities of the\nmountain, stationed themselves at different heights along the ridge,\nand began their search. They kept always to the right of their line of\ndescent, sounding the smallest fissures, descending to the bottom of\nprecipices half filled with fragments of the mass; and more than one\ncame forth with his garments in shreds, his feet and hands lacerated,\nat the peril of his life.\n\n[Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.]\n\nAll this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest. But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him.\n\nTowards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\"\n\nEach understood this determination, and respected it.\n\n\"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it. He\nhopes: but what does he hope?\"\n\n\"God knows!\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" replied Paganel, wiping his eyes.\n\nTrees thronged the valley in great numbers. The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert! Robert!\" a\nthousand times repeated, echo alone replied.\n\nDay dawned, and it was necessary to go in search of Glenarvan on\nthe mountain, and bring him in spite of his reluctance back to the\nencampment. His despair was terrible. Who would now dare to speak\nto him of departure, and propose leaving this fatal valley? But the\nprovisions were failing. They would soon meet the Argentine guides\nand horses to take them across the Pampas. To retrace their steps was\nmore difficult than to advance. Besides, the Atlantic was the place\nappointed to meet the Duncan. All these reasons did not permit a longer\ndelay, and it was for the interest of all that the hour for departure\nshould be no longer deferred.\n\nMacNabb attempted to draw Glenarvan from his grief. For a long time he\nspoke without his friend appearing to hear him. Glenarvan shook his\nhead. At length, words escaped his lips.\n\n\"Go?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, go.\"\n\n\"One hour more!\"\n\n\"Well, one hour more,\" replied the worthy major.\n\nWhen it had passed, Glenarvan asked for another. You would have thought\na condemned man was praying for his life. Thus it continued till about\nnoon, when MacNabb, by the advice of all, would no longer hesitate, and\ntold Glenarvan that they must go, the lives of his companions depended\nupon a prompt decision.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we will go, we will go!\"\n\nBut as he spoke his eyes were turned away from MacNabb. His gaze was\nfixed upon a black speck in the air. Suddenly his hand rose, and\nremained immovable, as if petrified.\n\n\"There! there!\" cried he. \"See! see!\"\n\n[Illustration: The bird had raised him by his garments, and was now\nhovering in mid-air at least one hundred and fifty feet above the\nencampment. He had perceived the travelers, and was violently striving\nto escape with his heavy prey.] All eyes were raised towards the sky,\nin the direction so imperatively indicated. At that moment the black\nspeck visibly increased. It was a bird hovering at a measureless height.\n\n\"A condor,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, a condor,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Who knows? He is coming, he is\ndescending! Let us wait.\"\n\nWhat did Glenarvan hope? Was his reason wandering? He had said, \"Who\nknows?\" Paganel was not mistaken. The condor became more distinct every\nmoment.\n\nThis magnificent bird, long revered by the Incas, is the king of\nthe southern Andes. In these regions he attains an extraordinary\ndevelopment. His strength is prodigious; and he often precipitates\noxen to the bottom of the abysses. He attacks sheep, goats, and calves\nwandering on the plain, and carries them in his talons to a great\nheight. Sometimes he hovers at an elevation beyond the limit of human\nvision, and there this king of the air surveys, with a piercing look,\nthe regions below, and distinguishes the faintest objects with a power\nof sight that is the astonishment of naturalists.\n\nWhat had the condor seen? A corpse,--that of Robert Grant? \"Who knows?\"\nrepeated Glenarvan, without losing sight of him. The enormous bird\napproached, now hovering, now falling with the swiftness of inert\nbodies. He soon described circles of larger extent, and could be\nperfectly distinguished. He measured fifteen feet across his wings,\nwhich supported him in the air almost without motion, for it is the\npeculiarity of these great birds to sail with a majestic calmness\nunlike all others of the winged tribes.\n\nThe major and Wilson had seized their rifles, but Glenarvan stopped\nthem with a gesture. The condor was approaching in the circles of his\nflight a sort of inaccessible plateau a quarter of a mile distant.\nHe was turning with a vertical rapidity, opening and closing his\nformidable claws, and shaking his cartilaginous neck.\n\n[Sidenote: SOMETHING WORSE.]\n\n\"There! there!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThen suddenly a thought flashed through his mind.\n\n\"If Robert is still living!\" exclaimed he, with a cry of terror, \"this\nbird! Fire, my friends, fire!\"\n\nBut he was too late. The condor had disappeared behind the lofty\nboulders. A second passed that seemed an eternity. Then the enormous\nbird reappeared, heavily laden, and rising slowly.\n\nA cry of horror was uttered. In the claws of the condor an inanimate\nbody was seen suspended and dangling. It was Robert Grant. The bird had\nraised him by his garments, and was now hovering in mid-air at least\none hundred and fifty feet above the encampment. He had perceived the\ntravelers, and was violently striving to escape with his heavy prey.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"May Robert's body be dashed upon these rocks,\" cried Glenarvan,\n\"rather than serve----\"\n\nHe did not finish, but, seizing Wilson's rifle, attempted to take aim\nat the condor. But his arm trembled; he could not sight the piece. His\neyes were dimmed.\n\n\"Let me try,\" said the major.\n\nWith clear eye, steady hand, and motionless body, he aimed at the bird,\nthat was already three hundred feet above him. But he had not pressed\nthe trigger, when a report resounded in the valley. A light smoke\ncurled up between two rocks, and the condor, shot in the head, fell,\nslowly turning, sustained by his broad outspread wings. He had not\nreleased his prey, and at last reached the ground, ten paces from the\nbanks of the stream.", "\"Quick! quick!\" said Glenarvan; and without seeking whence this\nprovidential shot had come, he rushed towards the condor. His\ncompanions closely followed him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Sidenote: \"THE LOST IS FOUND.\"]\n\nWhen they arrived the bird was dead, and the body of Robert was hidden\nunder its great wings. Glenarvan threw himself upon the child, released\nhim from the talons of the condor, stretched him on the grass, and\npressed his ear to his breast.\n\nNever did a wilder cry of joy issue from human lips than when Glenarvan\nrose, exclaiming:\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\"\n\nIn an instant Robert was stripped of his garments, and his face bathed\nwith fresh water. He made a movement, opened his eyes, looked around,\nand uttered a few words:\n\n\"You, my lord--my father!----\"\n\nGlenarvan could not speak. Emotion stifled him, and, kneeling, he wept\nbeside this child so miraculously saved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nTHALCAVE.\n\n\nAfter the great danger that he had just escaped, Robert incurred\nanother, no less great,--that of being overwhelmed with caresses.\nHowever feeble he was still, not one of these good people could refrain\nfrom pressing him to his heart. But it must be confessed that these\nwell-meant embraces are not fatal, for the boy did not die.\n\nWhen his rescue was certain, thought reverted to his rescuer, and the\nmajor very naturally thought of looking around him. Fifty paces from\nthe stream, a man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one\nof the first ledges of the mountain. A long gun lay at his feet. This\nindividual, who had so suddenly appeared, had broad shoulders, and\nlong hair tied with leathern thongs. His height exceeded six feet, and\nhis bronzed face was red between his eyes and mouth, black below his\neyelids, and white on his forehead. After the manner of the Patagonians\nof the frontiers, the native wore a splendid cloak, decorated with\nred arabesques, made of the skin of a guanaco, its silky fur turned\noutward, and sewed with ostrich-tendons. Under his cloak a tippet of\nfox-skin encircled his neck and terminated in a point in front. At his\ngirdle hung a little bag containing the colors with which he painted\nhis face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with\nstraps regularly crossed.\n\nThe figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real\nintelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it. He waited in\nan attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on\nhis pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue.\n\nThe major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him. The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head\ngently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend\ncould understand.\n\nThe Patagonian, after regarding the strangers attentively, now changed\nthe language; but whatever it was, this new idiom was no better\nunderstood than the first. However, certain expressions which he used\nstruck Glenarvan. They seemed to belong to the Spanish language, of\nwhich he knew several common words.\n\n\"Spanish?\" said he.\n\nThe Patagonian nodded.\n\n\"Well,\" said the major, \"this is our friend Paganel's business. It is\nfortunate that he thought of learning Spanish.\"\n\nPaganel was called. He came at once and with all the grace of a\nFrenchman saluted the Patagonian, to which the latter paid no\nattention. The geographer was informed of the state of affairs, and was\nonly too glad to use his diligently-acquired knowledge.\n\n[Sidenote: SOMETHING WRONG.]\n\n\"Exactly,\" said he. And opening his mouth widely in order to articulate\nbetter, he said, in his best Spanish,--\n\n\"You--are--a--brave--man.\"\n\nThe native listened, but did not answer.\n\n\"He does not understand,\" said the geographer.\n\n\"Perhaps you do not pronounce well,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Very true! Curse the pronunciation!\"\n\nAnd again Paganel began, but with no better success.\n\n\"I will change the expression,\" said he. And pronouncing with\nmagisterial slowness, he uttered these words,--\n\n\"A--Patagonian,--doubtless?\"\n\nThe native remained mute as before.\n\n\"Answer!\" added Paganel.\n\nThe Patagonian did not reply.\n\n\"Do--you--understand?\" cried Paganel, violently enough to damage his\norgans of speech.\n\nIt was evident that the Indian did not understand, for he answered, but\nin Spanish,--\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\nIt was Paganel's turn now to be astonished, and he hastily put on his\nglasses, like one irritated.\n\n\"May I be hanged,\" said he, \"if I understand a word of this infernal\njargon! It is certainly Araucanian.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Glenarvan; \"this man answered in Spanish.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Patagonian, he repeated,--\n\n\"Spanish?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the native.\n\nPaganel's surprise became amazement. The major and Glenarvan looked at\nhim quizzingly.\n\n\"Ah, my learned friend!\" said the major, while a half smile played\nabout his lips, \"you have committed one of those blunders peculiar to\nyou.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the geographer, starting.\n\n\"Yes, it is plain that this Patagonian speaks Spanish.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n[Illustration: A man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on\none of the first ledges of the mountain. This individual had broad\nshoulders, and long hair tied with leathern thongs.]\n\n[Sidenote: A PENINSULAR BABEL.]\n\n\"Yes. By mistake you have learnt another language, while thinking that\nyou studied----\"\n\nMacNabb did not finish. A loud \"Oh!\" from the geographer, accompanied\nby shrugs of the shoulders, cut him short.\n\n\"Major, you are going a little too far,\" said Paganel in a very dry\ntone.\n\n\"To be sure, since you do not understand.\"\n\n\"I do not understand because this native speaks so badly!\" answered the\ngeographer, who began to be impatient.\n\n\"That is to say, he speaks badly, because you do not understand,\"\nreturned the major, calmly.\n\n\"MacNabb,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is not a probable supposition. However\nabstracted our friend Paganel may be, we cannot suppose that his\nblunder was to learn one language for another.\"\n\n\"Now, my dear Edward, or rather you, my good Paganel, explain to me\nwhat the difficulty is.\"\n\n\"I will not explain,\" replied Paganel, \"I insist. Here is the book\nin which I practice daily the difficulties of the Spanish language!\nExamine it, major, and you will see whether I impose upon you.\"\n\nSo saying, Paganel groped in his numerous pockets. After searching a\nfew moments, he drew forth a volume in a very bad state, and presented\nit with an air of assurance. The major took the book, and looked at it.\n\n\"Well, what work is this?\" he asked.\n\n\"The Lusiad,\" replied Paganel; \"an admirable poem which----\"\n\n\"The Lusiad!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my friend, the Lusiad of the immortal Camo\u00ebns, nothing more or\nless.\"\n\n\"Camo\u00ebns!\" repeated Glenarvan; \"but, unfortunate friend, Camo\u00ebns was\na Portuguese! It is Portuguese that you have been studying for six\nweeks.\"\n\n\"Camo\u00ebns! Lusiad! Portuguese!\"\n\nPaganel could say no more. His eyes wandered, while a peal of Homeric\nlaughter rang in his ears.\n\nThe Patagonian did not wink; he waited patiently for the explanation of\nthis event, which was totally incomprehensible to him.\n\n\"Insensate! fool!\" cried Paganel, at last. \"What! is it so? Is it not\na mere joke? Have I done this? It is the confusion of languages, as at\nBabel. My friends! my friends! to start for India and arrive at Chili!\nto learn Spanish and speak Portuguese! this is too much, and, if it\ncontinues, I shall some day throw myself out of the window instead of\nmy cigar.\"\n\nTo hear Paganel take his blunder thus, to see his comical actions, it\nwas impossible to keep serious. Besides, he set the example himself.\n\n\"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\"\n\nAnd he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer.\n\n\"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major.\n\n\"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\"\n\nPaganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms.\n\n[Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.]\n\nBut Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant.\n\nIn the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting.", "Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day. Nevertheless,\nthey advanced rapidly, and towards six o'clock the Andes, forty miles\ndistant, presented a darkish aspect already fading in the mists of the\nevening.\n\nThe travelers were a little fatigued with their journey, and,\ntherefore, saw with pleasure the approach of the hour for retiring.\nThey encamped on the shores of a turbulent stream, enclosed by lofty\nred cliffs. Toward noon of the next day, the sun's rays became very\noppressive, and at evening a line of clouds on the horizon indicated\na change in the weather. The Patagonian could not be deceived, and\npointed out to the geographer the western portion of the sky.\n\n\"Good, I know,\" said Paganel, and addressing his companions: \"A change\nin the weather is about to take place. We shall have a 'pampero.'\"\n\n[Sidenote: TALKING LIKE A BOOK.]\n\nHe explained that this pampero is frequent on the Argentine Plains. It\nis a very dry wind from the southwest. Thalcave was not mistaken, and\nduring the night, which was quite uncomfortable for people sheltered\nwith a simple poncho, the wind blew with great violence. The horses lay\ndown on the ground, and the men near them in a close group. Glenarvan\nfeared they would be delayed if the storm continued; but Paganel\nreassured him after consulting his barometer.\n\n\"Ordinarily,\" said he, \"this wind creates tempests, which last for\nthree days; but when the barometer rises as it does now, you are free\nfrom these furious hurricanes in a few hours. Be assured, then, my dear\nfriend; at break of day the sky will have resumed its usual clearness.\"\n\n\"You talk like a book, Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"And I am one,\" replied Paganel, \"which you are free to consult as much\nas you please.\"\n\nHe was not mistaken. At one o'clock in the morning the wind suddenly\nsubsided, and every one was able to enjoy an invigorating sleep. The\nnext morning they rose bright and fresh, especially Paganel, who\ndisplayed great cheerfulness and animation.\n\nDuring this passage across the continent, Lord Glenarvan watched with\nscrupulous attention for the approach of the natives. He wished to\nquestion them concerning Captain Grant, by the aid of the Patagonian,\nwith whom Paganel had begun to converse considerably. But they\nfollowed a path little frequented by the Indians, for the trails over\nthe Pampas, which lead from the Argentine Republic to the Andes, are\nsituated too far to the north. If by chance a wandering horseman\nappeared in the distance, he fled rapidly away, little caring to come\nin contact with strangers.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan, in the interest of his search, regretted\nthe absence of the Indians, an incident took place which singularly\njustified the interpretation of the document.", "However, although Glenarvan, in the interest of his search, regretted\nthe absence of the Indians, an incident took place which singularly\njustified the interpretation of the document.\n\nSeveral times the course pursued by the expedition crossed paths on\nthe Pampas, among others quite an important road--that from Carmen to\nMendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses,\nsheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and\nlay bleaching in the sun. There were thousands of them, and, without\ndoubt, more than one human skeleton had added its bones to those of\nthese humbler animals.\n\nHitherto Thalcave had made no remark concerning the line so rigorously\nfollowed. He understood, however, that if they kept no definite\ncourse over the Pampas, they would not come to cities or villages.\nEvery morning they advanced towards the rising sun, without deviating\nfrom the straight line, and every evening the setting sun was behind\nthem. In his capacity of guide, Thalcave must, therefore, have been\nastonished to see that not only he did not guide them, but that they\nguided him. Nevertheless, if he was astonished, with the reserve\nnatural to the Indians he made no remark. But to-day arriving at the\nabove-mentioned road, he stopped his horse, and turned towards Paganel.\n\n\"Road to Carmen,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, my good Patagonian,\" replied the geographer, in his purest\nSpanish; \"road to Carmen and Mendoza.\"\n\n\"We do not take it?\" resumed Thalcave.\n\n\"No,\" answered Paganel.\n\n\"And we are going----?\"\n\n\"Always to the east.\"\n\n\"That is going nowhere.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\"\n\nThalcave was silent, and gazed at the geographer with profound\nsurprise. He did not admit, however, that Paganel was joking the least\nin the world. An Indian, with his natural seriousness, never imagines\nthat you are not speaking in earnest.\n\n\"You are not going to Carmen then?\" he added, after an instant of\nsilence.\n\n[Sidenote: A PROFESSORIAL DIFFICULTY.]\n\n\"No,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Nor to Mendoza?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan, rejoining Paganel, asked what Thalcave said,\nand why he had stopped.\n\nWhen he had told him, Glenarvan said,--\n\n\"Could you not explain to him the object of our expedition, and why we\nmust always proceed toward the east?\"\n\n\"That would be very difficult,\" answered Paganel, \"for an Indian\nunderstands nothing of geography.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the major seriously, \"is it the history, or the historian,\nthat he cannot understand?\"\n\n\"Ah, MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"you still doubt my Spanish!\"\n\n\"Try, my worthy friend.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nPaganel turned to the Patagonian, and began a discourse, frequently\ninterrupted for want of words and from the difficulty of explaining to\na half-ignorant savage details which were rather incomprehensible to\nhim.\n\nThe geographer was just then a curious sight. He gesticulated,\narticulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great\ndrops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer\nmove, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the\nsand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the\ntwo oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such\nembarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether\nhe comprehended or not.\n\nThe lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel\nceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at\nthe Patagonian.\n\n\"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\"\n\n[Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"]\n\nThalcave did not stir. He no longer spoke. His eyes were fixed upon\nthe figures traced on the sand, which the wind was gradually effacing.\n\n[Illustration: An important road--that from Carmen to\nMendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses,\nsheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and\nlay bleaching in the sun.]\n\n\"Well?\" asked Paganel.\n\nThalcave did not appear to hear him. Paganel already saw an ironical\nsmile forming upon the lips of the major, and, wishing to save\nhis reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical\ndemonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture.\n\n\"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said\nThalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course\nfrom west to east.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is it!\"\n\n\"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the\nwaves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\"\n\n\"God himself.\"\n\n\"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain\nsolemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\"\n\nPaganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to\nhis companions the replies of the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard\nof any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was\naccordingly done.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian.\n\nAs soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language.\n\n\"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\"\n\n\"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\"\n\n\"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\"\n\n\"My father!\" cried Robert Grant.\n\nThen, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer.\n\nImmediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened.\n\nHe took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked.\n\n\"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave.\n\n\"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThis last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He\nwas surprised to find the depth so great as it really was, this being\nthe result of the snow having melted rapidly under the first heat of\nsummer. The width likewise of this stream was so considerable that it\nwas almost impossible for their horses to swim across; but they happily\ndiscovered a sort of weir-bridge, of wattles looped and fastened\ntogether, which the Indians were in the habit of using; and by its aid\nthe little troop was enabled to pass over to the left bank, where they\nrested for the night.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nA SERIOUS NECESSITY.\n\n\nThey set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk pace among\nthe tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the Indians\nas a shelter during the storms. At certain distances, but less and\nless frequent, pools of shallow water contributed to the growth of\nwillows and a certain plant which is found in the neighborhood of\nfresh water. Here the horses drank their fill, to fortify themselves\nfor the journey. Thalcave, who rode in advance, beat the bushes, and\nthus frightened away the \"cholinas\" (vipers), while the agile Thaouka\nbounded over all obstacles, and aided his master in clearing a passage\nfor the horses that followed.\n\n[Illustration: They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk\npace among the tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the\nIndians as a shelter during the storms.]", "[Illustration: They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk\npace among the tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the\nIndians as a shelter during the storms.]\n\nEarly in the afternoon, the first traces of animals were\nencountered--the bones of an innumerable drove of cattle, in whitened\nheaps. These fragments did not extend in a winding line, such as\nanimals exhausted and falling one by one would leave behind them. Thus\nno one, not even Paganel, knew how to explain this chain of skeletons\nin a space comparatively circumscribed. He therefore questioned\nThalcave, who was not at a loss for a reply.\n\n\"What is this?\" they asked, after Paganel had inquired of the Indian.\n\n\"The fire of heaven,\" replied the geographer.\n\n\"What! the lightning could not have produced such a disaster,\" said Tom\nAustin, \"and stretched five hundred head of cattle on the earth!\"\n\nBut Thalcave reaffirmed it, and he was not mistaken; for the storms of\nthe Pampas are noted for their violence.\n\nAt evening they stopped at an abandoned rancho, made of interlaced\nbranches plastered with mud and covered with thatch. This structure\nstood within an inclosure of half-rotten stakes which, however,\nsufficed to protect the horses during the night against the attacks of\nthe foxes. Not that they had anything to fear personally from these\nanimals, but the malicious beasts gnawed the halters, so that the\nhorses could escape.\n\nA few paces from the rancho, a hole was dug which served as a kitchen\nand contained half-cooled embers. Within, there was a bench, a bed of\nox-hide, a saucepan, a spit, and a pot for boiling mat\u00e9. The mat\u00e9 is\na drink very much in use in South America. It is the Indian's tea,\nconsisting of a decoction of leaves dried in the fire, and is imbibed\nthrough a straw. At Paganel's request, Thalcave prepared several\ncups of this beverage, which very agreeably accompanied the ordinary\neatables, and was declared excellent.\n\n[Sidenote: A CHANGE FOR THE WORSE.]\n\nThe next day they resumed their journey towards the east. About noon\na change took place in the appearance of the Pampas, which could\nnot escape eyes wearied with its monotony. The grass became more and\nmore scanty, and gave place to sickly burdocks and gigantic thistles;\nwhile stunted nettles and other thorny shrubs grew here and there.\nHeretofore, a certain moisture, preserved by the clay of the prairie,\nfreshened the meadows; the vegetation was thick and luxuriant. But now\na patchy growth, bare in many places, exposed the earth, and indicated\nthe poverty of the soil. These signs of increasing dryness could not be\nmistaken, and Thalcave called attention to them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I am not sorry at this change,\" said Tom Austin; \"to see always grass,\nnothing but grass, becomes tiresome before long.\"\n\n\"But where there is grass there is water,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Oh, we are not in want,\" said Wilson, \"and shall find some river on\nour course.\"\n\nHowever, when Wilson said that the supply of water would not fail\nhe had not calculated for the unquenchable thirst that consumed his\ncompanions all that day; and, when he added that they would meet with\nsome stream in their journey he had anticipated too much. Indeed, not\nonly were rivers wanting, but even the artificial wells dug by the\nIndians were empty. On seeing these indications of dryness increase\nfrom mile to mile, Paganel asked Thalcave where he expected to find\nwater.\n\n\"At Lake Salinas,\" replied the Indian.\n\n\"And when shall we arrive there?\"\n\n\"To-morrow evening.\"\n\nThe natives ordinarily, when they travel on the Pampas, dig wells, and\nfind water a few feet below the surface; but the travelers, destitute\nof the necessary implements, could not employ this expedient. It was\ntherefore necessary to obtain a supply in some other way, for, if they\ndid not absolutely suffer from the tormenting desire for drink, no one\ncould entirely allay his thirst.\n\nAt evening they halted, after a journey of thirty miles. Every one\nrelied upon a good night to recruit himself after the fatigues of\nthe day; but they were greatly annoyed by a very persistent swarm of\nmosquitoes, which disappeared, however, after the wind changed.\n\nIf the major preserved his calmness in the midst of the petty\nannoyances of life, Paganel, on the contrary, could not treat the\nmatter so indifferently. He fought the mosquitoes, and sadly regretted\nthe absence of his acid-water, which would have soothed the pain of\ntheir bites. Although the major endeavored to console him, he awoke in\na very bad humor.\n\nHowever, he was very easily persuaded to set out at daybreak, for it\nwas important to arrive at Lake Salinas the same day. The horses were\nvery much exhausted: they were dying of thirst; and, although their\nriders had denied themselves on their account, still their share of\nwater had been very limited. The dryness was to-day even greater, and\nthe heat no less intolerable, with the dusty wind, the simoom of the\nPampas.\n\n[Sidenote: INDIANS AHEAD!]\n\nDuring the day the monotony of the journey was interrupted. Mulready,\nwho rode in advance, turned back, signaling the approach of a party of\nIndians. This meeting elicited different opinions. Glenarvan thought\nof the information that these natives might furnish concerning the\nshipwrecked seamen of the Britannia. Thalcave, for his part, scarcely\nenjoyed meeting in his journey the wandering Indians of the plains.\nHe considered them plunderers and robbers, and only sought to avoid\nthem. According to his orders, the little party collected together, and\nmade ready their fire-arms. It was necessary to be prepared for any\nemergency.\n\nThe Indian detachment was soon perceived. It consisted of only ten\nmen, which fact reassured the Patagonian. They approached within a\nhundred paces, so that they could be easily distinguished. Their high\nforeheads, prominent rather than receding, their tall forms, and their\nolive color, showed them to be magnificent types of the Indian race.\nThey were clad in the skins of guanacos, and carried various weapons of\nwar and the chase, while their dexterity in horsemanship was remarkable.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHaving halted, they appeared to hold a conference, crying and\ngesticulating. Glenarvan advanced toward them; but he had not proceeded\ntwo yards, when the detachment wheeled about and disappeared with\nincredible swiftness. The tired horses of the travelers could never\nhave overtaken them.\n\n\"The cowards!\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"They fly too fast for honest men,\" said MacNabb.\n\n\"What are these Indians?\" inquired Paganel of Thalcave.\n\n\"Gauchos!\" replied the Patagonian.\n\n\"Gauchos!\" repeated Paganel, turning toward his companions, \"Gauchos!\nWe had no need, then, to take such precautions. There was nothing to\nfear!\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Because the Gauchos are inoffensive peasants.\"\n\n\"Do you think so, Paganel?\"\n\n\"Certainly. They took us for robbers, and fled.\"\n\nGlenarvan was quite disappointed in not speaking with them, as he\nexpected to obtain additional tidings of the lost sailors; but it\nwas necessary to push on, if they would reach their destination that\nevening.\n\nAt eight o'clock Thalcave, who had gone a little in advance, announced\nthat the lake so long desired was in sight. A quarter of an hour\nafterward the little party descended the high banks. But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nIN SEARCH OF WATER.\n\n\nLake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin.\n\nWhen Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself.\nThe burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas.\n\nIt was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly.\n\nWhen each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done. A rapid conversation, of which\nGlenarvan caught a few words, ensued between the geographer and the\nIndian. Thalcave spoke calmly, while Paganel gesticulated for both.\nThis consultation lasted a few minutes, and then the Patagonian folded\nhis arms.\n\n\"What did he say?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"I thought I understood him to\nadvise us to separate.\"\n\n\"Yes, into two parties,\" replied Paganel. \"Those of us whose horses are\nso overcome with fatigue and thirst that they can scarcely move will\ncontinue the journey as well as possible. Those who are better mounted,\non the contrary, will ride in advance, and reconnoitre the Guamini\nRiver, which empties into Lake San Lucas. If there is sufficient water\nthere, they will wait for their companions on the banks of the stream;\nif not, they will return to save the rest a useless journey.\"\n\n\"And then?\" asked Tom Austin.\n\n\"Then we must go southward to the first branches of the Ventana\nmountains, where the rivers are numerous.\"\n\n\"The plan is good,\" replied Glenarvan, \"and we will follow it without\ndelay. My horse has not suffered so much yet from want of water, and I\noffer to accompany Thalcave.\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord, take me!\" cried Robert, as if a pleasure excursion were\nin question.\n\n\"But can you keep up with us, my child?\"", "\"Oh, my lord, take me!\" cried Robert, as if a pleasure excursion were\nin question.\n\n\"But can you keep up with us, my child?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have a good beast that asks nothing better than to go in\nadvance. Will you, my lord? I beseech you!\"\n\n\"Come then, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, delighted not to be separated from\nRobert. \"And we three,\" he added, \"will be very stupid if we do not\ndiscover some clear and fresh stream.\"\n\n\"And I?\" said Paganel.\n\n\"Oh, you, my dear Paganel!\" replied the major, \"you will remain with\nthe reserve detachment. You know the course, the Guamini River, and the\nPampas, too well to abandon us. Neither Wilson, Mulready, nor myself\nare capable of rejoining Thalcave at his rendezvous, unless we advance\nconfidently under the guidance of the brave Jacques Paganel.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Poor father!\" exclaimed Robert; \"how he will thank you\nwhen you have found him!\" And, so saying, he took his lordship's hand\nand pressed it to his lips.]\n\n\"I resign,\" said the geographer, very much flattered to obtain a higher\ncommand.\n\n\"But no distractions!\" added the major. \"Do not lead us where we have\nnothing to do, and bring us back to the shores of the Pacific!\"\n\n\"You would deserve it, my intolerable major,\" said Paganel, smiling.\n\"But tell me, my dear Glenarvan, how will you understand Thalcave's\nlanguage?\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" answered Glenarvan, \"that the Patagonian and I will not\nneed to talk. Besides, with the few Spanish words that I know, I shall\nsucceed well enough on an emergency in giving him my opinion and\nunderstanding his.\"\n\n\"Go then, my worthy friend,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Let us eat first,\" said Glenarvan, \"and sleep till the hour of\ndeparture.\"\n\nThey ate supper without drink, which was rather unrefreshing, and then\nfell asleep. Paganel dreamed of torrents, cascades, streams, rivers,\nponds, brooks, nay even full bottles, in short, of everything which\ngenerally contains water. It was a real nightmare.\n\nThe next morning at six o'clock the horses were saddled. They gave them\nthe last drink of water left, which they took with more dislike than\npleasure, for it was very nauseating. The three horsemen then mounted.\n\n\"_Au revoir!_\" said the major, Austin, Wilson, and Mulready.\n\nSoon the Patagonian, Glenarvan, and Robert (not without a certain\nthrobbing of the heart) lost sight of the detachment confided to the\nsagacity of the geographer.\n\n[Sidenote: THE YOUNG SAILOR ON HORSEBACK.]\n\nThalcave was right in first proceeding towards the Guamini, since this\nstream lay on the prescribed course, and was the nearest. The three\nhorses galloped briskly forward. These excellent beasts perceived,\ndoubtless, by instinct, whither their masters were guiding them.\nThaouka, especially, showed a spirit that neither fatigue nor thirst\ncould overcome. The other horses followed, at a slower pace, but\nincited by his example.\n\nThe Patagonian frequently turned his head to look at Robert Grant, and,\nseeing the young boy firm and erect, in an easy and graceful position,\ntestified his satisfaction by a word of encouragement.\n\n\"Bravo, Robert!\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave seems to congratulate you.\nHe praises you, my boy!\"\n\n\"And why, my lord?\"\n\n\"Because of the way you ride.\"\n\n\"Oh, I merely keep firm; that is all,\" replied Robert, who blushed with\npleasure at hearing himself complimented.\n\n\"That is the main point, Robert,\" said Glenarvan; \"but you are too\nmodest, and I am sure you cannot fail to become an accomplished\nequestrian.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Robert, \"but what will papa say, who wishes to make a\nsailor of me?\"\n\n\"The one does not interfere with the other. If all horsemen do not make\ngood sailors, all sailors may certainly make good horsemen. To ride on\nthe yards, you must learn to keep yourself firm. As for knowing how to\nmanage your horse, that comes more easily.\"\n\n\"Poor father!\" exclaimed Robert; \"how he will thank you when you have\nfound him!\" And, so saying, he took his lordship's hand and pressed it\nto his lips.\n\n\"You love him well, Robert?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; he was so kind to sister and me. He thought only of us,\nand every voyage brought us a memento of the countries he visited, and,\nwhat was better, tender caresses and kind words, on his return. Ah!\nyou will love him too, when you know him! Mary resembles him. He has a\nsweet voice like her. It is singular for a sailor, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, very singular, Robert,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"I see him still,\" replied the boy, as if speaking to himself. \"Good\nand brave papa! He rocked me to sleep on his knees, when I was little,\nand kept humming an old Scottish song which is sung around the lakes of\nour country. I sometimes recall the air, but indistinctly. How we loved\nhim, my lord! Well, I think one must be very young to love his father\nwell.\"\n\n\"And old to reverence him, my child,\" replied Glenarvan, quite moved by\nthe words that came from this young heart.\n\nDuring this conversation, their horses had relaxed their pace and\nfallen behind the other; but Thalcave called them, and they resumed\ntheir former gait. It was soon evident, however, that, with the\nexception of Thaouka, the horses could not long maintain this speed. At\nnoon it was necessary to give them an hour's rest.\n\nGlenarvan grew uneasy. The signs of dryness did not diminish, and the\nwant of water might result in disastrous consequences. Thalcave said\nnothing, but probably thought that if the Guamini was dry it would then\nbe time to despair, if indeed an Indian's heart has ever experienced\nsuch an emotion.\n\nThey therefore kept on, and by use of whip and spur the horses were\ninduced to continue their journey, but they could not quicken their\npace. Thalcave might easily have gone ahead, for in a few hours Thaouka\ncould have carried him to the banks of the stream. He doubtless thought\nof it, but probably did not like to leave his two companions alone in\nthe midst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim. The Patagonian must have used excellent arguments, for, after\n\"discussing\" some time, Thaouka yielded, and obeyed his master's\ncommands.\n\n[Sidenote: GAINED AT LAST.]\n\nBut, if Thaouka understood Thalcave, Thalcave had none the less\nunderstood Thaouka. The intelligent animal, through his superior\ninstincts, had perceived a moisture in the air. He inhaled it eagerly,\nand kept moving his tongue, as if it were steeped in a grateful liquid.\nThe Patagonian could not be deceived; water was not far distant.\n\nHe therefore encouraged his companions by explaining the impatience of\nhis horse, which the others were not long in understanding. They made a\nfinal effort, and galloped after the Indian.\n\nAbout three o'clock a bright line appeared in a hollow of the plain. It\ntrembled under the rays of the sun.\n\n\"Water!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Water, yes, water!\" cried Robert.\n\nThey had no more need to urge their horses. The poor beasts, feeling\ntheir strength renewed, rushed forward with an irresistible eagerness.\nIn a few moments they had reached the Guamini River, and, saddled as\nthey were, plunged to their breasts into the cooling stream. Their\nmasters imitated their example, without reluctance, and took an\nafternoon bath which was as healthful as it was pleasant.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Ah, how good it is!\" said Robert, as he quenched his thirst in the\nmiddle of the river.\n\n\"Be moderate, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, who did not set a good example.\n\nNothing was heard but the sound of rapid drinking. As for Thalcave,\nhe drank quietly, without hurrying, long and deeply, till they might\nperhaps fear that the stream would be drained.\n\n\"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"our friends will not be disappointed in their\nexpectations. They are sure, on arriving at the Guamini, to find an\nabundance of clear water, if Thalcave leaves any!\"\n\n\"But could we not go to meet them?\" asked Robert. \"We could spare them\nseveral hours of anxiety.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, my boy; but how carry the water? Wilson has charge of the\nwater-bottles. No, it is better to wait, as we agreed. Calculating the\nnecessary time, and the slow pace of the horses, our friends will be\nhere at night. Let us, then, prepare them a safe shelter and a good\nrepast.\"\n\nThalcave had not waited for Glenarvan's orders to search for a place\nto encamp. He had very fortunately found on the banks of the river a\n\"ramada,\" a kind of inclosure designed for a cattle-fold and shut in\non three sides. The situation was excellent for the purpose, so long\nas one did not fear to sleep in the open air; and that was the least\nanxiety of Thalcave's companions. Thus they did not seek a better\nretreat, but stretched themselves on the ground in the sun to dry their\nwater-soaked garments.\n\n\"Well, since here is shelter,\" said Glenarvan, \"let us think of supper.\nOur friends must be satisfied with the couriers whom they have sent\nforward; and, if I am not greatly mistaken, they will have no reason\nto complain. I think an hour's hunting will not be time lost. Are you\nready, Robert?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied he, with gun in hand.\n\n[Sidenote: AN EVENING'S SPORT.]\n\nGlenarvan had conceived this idea because the banks of the Guamini\nseemed to be the haunt of the game of the surrounding plains.\n\"Tinamous,\" a kind of partridge, plovers called \"teru-teru,\" yellow\nrails, and water-fowl of magnificent green were seen rising in flocks.\nAs for quadrupeds, they did not make their appearance; but Thalcave,\npointing to the tall grass and thick coppice, explained that they\nwere hidden there. The hunters had only to take a few steps to find\nthemselves in one of the best game-coverts in the world.\n\n[Illustration]", "[Illustration]\n\nThey began to hunt, therefore, and, disdaining the feathered tribe,\ntheir first attempts were made upon the large game of the Pampas. Soon\nhares and guanacos, like those that had attacked them so violently on\nthe Andes, started up before them by hundreds; but these very timid\nanimals fled with such swiftness that it was impossible to come within\ngun-shot. The hunters, therefore, attacked other game that was less\nfleet. A dozen partridges and rails were brought down, and Glenarvan\nshot a peccary, which was very good eating.\n\nIn less than half an hour they had obtained without difficulty all the\ngame they needed. Robert captured a curious animal called an armadillo,\nwhich was covered with a sort of helmet of movable bony pieces and\nmeasured a foot and a half in length. It was very fat, and would be an\nexcellent dish, as the Patagonian said; while Robert was proud of his\nsuccess.\n\nAs for Thalcave, he showed his companions a \"nandou\" hunt. This bird,\npeculiar to the Pampas, is a kind of ostrich, whose swiftness is\nmarvelous.\n\nThe Indian did not try to decoy so nimble an animal, but urged his\nhorse to a gallop, straight towards the bird, so as to overtake it\nat once, for, if the first attack should fail, the nandou would soon\nfatigue both horse and rider with its giddy backward and forward\nmovements.\n\nThalcave, arriving at a proper distance, launched his \"bolas\" with a\nstrong hand, and so skillfully that they twisted about the legs of\nthe ostrich and paralyzed its efforts. In a few moments it lay on\nthe ground. The Indian soon captured his prize and contributed it\nto the common repast. The string of partridges, Thalcave's ostrich,\nGlenarvan's peccary, and Robert's armadillo were brought back to camp.\nThe ostrich and the peccary were immediately stripped of their skin\nand cut into small slices. As for the armadillo, it is a dainty animal\nwhich carries its roasting dish with it, and it was, accordingly,\nplaced in its own bony covering on the glowing embers.\n\nThe three hunters were satisfied with the partridges for supper, and\nkept the rounds of beef for their friends. This repast was washed down\nwith clear water, which was then considered superior to all the wines\nin the world.\n\nThe horses were not forgotten. A great quantity of dry fodder, piled in\nthe ramada, served them for food and bedding.\n\n[Sidenote: DESERT SILENCE.]\n\nWhen everything was ready, Glenarvan, Robert, and the Indian wrapped\nthemselves in their ponchos, and stretched their limbs on a bundle of\nalfafares, the usual bed of the hunters of the Pampas.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nTHE RED WOLVES.\n\n\nNight came,--the night of the new moon, only the uncertain light of\nthe stars illumined the plain. On the horizon the zodiacal light faded\naway in a dark mist. The waters of the Guamini flowed without a murmur,\nwhile birds, quadrupeds, and reptiles reposed after the fatigues of\nthe day. The silence of the desert reigned on the vast expanse of the\nPampas.\n\nGlenarvan, Robert, and Thalcave had yielded to the common law, and,\nstretched on their thick beds of grass, they enjoyed a refreshing\nsleep. The horses, overcome with fatigue, had lain down on the ground:\nThaouka alone, like a true blooded horse, slept standing, spirited in\nrepose as in action, and ready to start at the least sign from his\nmaster. Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the\nembers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last\nrays over the silent obscurity.\n\nAbout ten o'clock, after a short sleep, the Indian awoke. His eyes\nbecame fixed beneath his lowered eyebrows, and his head was turned in a\nlistening attitude towards the plain. He seemed endeavoring to detect\nsome scarcely perceptible sound. A vague uneasiness was soon expressed\non his face, usually so calm. Had he perceived the approach of prowling\nIndians, or the coming of jaguars, water-tigers, and other formidable\nbeasts which are numerous in the neighborhood of rivers? This last\npossibility doubtless appeared plausible to him, for he cast a rapid\nglance over the combustible materials piled in the inclosure, and his\nanxiety increased. In fact, all this dry bedding would quickly be\nconsumed, and could not long intimidate the audacious animals.\n\nAccording to this conjecture, Thalcave had only to await the progress\nof events, which he did, half reclining, his head resting on his hands,\nhis elbows on his knees, his eyes motionless, in the attitude of a man\nwhom a sudden anxiety has awakened from sleep.\n\nAn hour passed. Any other person but Thalcave, reassured by the outward\nsilence, would have lain down again. But where a stranger would have\nsuspected nothing, the highly-trained senses and natural instinct of\nthe Indian foresaw the coming danger.\n\nWhile he was listening and watching, Thaouka gave a low neigh. His\nnose was stretched towards the entrance to the ramada. The Patagonian\nsuddenly started.\n\n\"Thaouka has scented some enemy,\" said he.\n\nHe arose and scanned the plain attentively. Silence still reigned, but\nnot tranquillity. Thalcave discerned shadows moving noiselessly among\nthe tufts of grass. Here and there glittered luminous points, which\nspread on all sides, now fading away, and now gleaming forth again. You\nwould have thought fantastic elves were dancing on the surface of an\nimmense lagoon. A stranger would doubtless have taken these flitting\nsparks for glow-worms, which shine, when night comes, in many parts of\nthe Pampas. But Thalcave was not deceived; he knew with what enemies he\nhad to deal. He loaded his carbine, and took a position near the first\nstakes of the inclosure.\n\nHe did not wait long. A strange cry, a mingling of barks and howls,\nresounded over the plain. The report of the carbine answered it,\nand was followed by a hundred frightful yelps. Glenarvan and Robert\nsuddenly awoke.\n\n[Sidenote: FEARFUL ODDS.]\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Robert.\n\n\"Indians?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Thalcave, \"aguaras.\"\n\nRobert looked at Glenarvan.\n\n\"Aguaras?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"the red wolves of the Pampas.\"\n\nBoth seized their weapons, and joined the Indian. The latter pointed\nto the plain, from which arose a series of formidable howls. Robert\ninvoluntarily took a step backward.\n\n\"You are not afraid of the wolves, my boy?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied Robert, in a firm tone. \"With you I fear\nnothing.\"\n\n\"So much the better. These aguaras are not very formidable beasts; and\nwere it not for their numbers I should not even think of them.\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\" replied Robert. \"We are well armed. Let them\ncome.\"\n\n\"And they shall be well received.\"\n\nSpeaking thus, Glenarvan endeavored to reassure the lad; but he did\nnot think without a secret terror of that dense horde of exasperated\nbeasts. Perhaps there were hundreds of them; and these three, however\nwell armed, could not advantageously contend against so many and such\nantagonists.\n\nBy the howls that resounded over the Pampas, and by the multitude of\nshadows that flitted about the plain, Glenarvan could not be mistaken\nas to the number. These animals had scented a sure prey, horse-flesh or\nhuman flesh, and not one among them would return to his lair without\nhaving his portion. The situation was, therefore, very alarming.\n\nMeanwhile the circle of wolves grew gradually narrower. The horses,\nawakened, gave signs of the liveliest terror. Thaouka alone pawed the\nground, seeking to break his halter, and ready to rush out. His master\nsucceeded in calming him only by whistling continually.\n\nGlenarvan and Robert had stationed themselves so as to defend the\nentrance of the ramada, and with their loaded rifles were about to fire\nat the first ranks of wolves, when Thalcave turned aside their weapons\nalready poised for a shot.\n\n\"What does Thalcave wish?\" asked Robert.\n\n\"He prohibits us from firing,\" answered Glenarvan.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he does not consider it the proper time.\"\n\nThis was not, however, the motive which actuated the Indian, but a\ngraver reason, which Glenarvan understood when Thalcave, raising his\npowder-flask and inverting it, showed that it was almost empty.\n\n\"Well?\" said Robert.\n\n\"We must economize our ammunition. Our hunt to-day has cost us dear,\nand we are deficient in powder and shot. We have not twenty charges\nleft.\"\n\nThe boy answered nothing.\n\n\"You are not afraid, Robert?\"\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Very well, my boy.\"\n\nAt this moment another report resounded. Thalcave had brought down a\ntoo bold enemy. The wolves that were advancing in close ranks recoiled,\nand gathered together again a hundred paces from the inclosure.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST HOUR.]\n\nGlenarvan, at a sign from the Indian, took his place at once, while the\nlatter, collecting the bedding, grass, and all combustible materials,\npiled them at the entrance of the ramada and threw on a burning ember.\nSoon a curtain of flame was defined against the dark background of the\nsky, and through the openings the plain appeared illumined by great\nmoving reflections. Glenarvan could therefore judge of the great number\nof animals against which they had to defend themselves. Never had so\nmany wolves been seen together before, nor so excited by rapacity. The\nfiery barrier that Thalcave had just opposed to them had redoubled\ntheir fury. Some, however, advanced to the very fire, crowded by\nthe rear ranks, and burned their paws. From time to time a shot was\nnecessary to check the howling horde, and at the end of an hour fifteen\nbodies lay on the prairie.\n\nThe besieged were now in a situation relatively less dangerous. So long\nas their supplies lasted, so long as the barrier of fire stood at the\nentrance to the ramada, invasion was not to be feared. But what was to\nbe done if all these methods of repelling the wolves should fail at the\nsame time?", "Glenarvan gazed at Robert, and felt his heart beat quick with\nexcitement. He forgot himself, and thought only of this poor child, who\ndisplayed a courage beyond his years. Robert was pale, but his hand did\nnot leave his weapon, and he awaited with firm bearing the assault of\nthe enraged wolves.\n\nMeantime, Glenarvan, after coolly considering the situation, resolved\nto do something decisive.\n\n\"In one hour,\" said he, \"we shall have no more powder, shot, or fire.\nWe must not wait till then to make a sally.\"\n\nHe turned towards Thalcave, and, recalling a few words of Spanish,\nbegan a conversation with the Indian, frequently interrupted by the\ncracks of the rifle.\n\nIt was not without difficulty that these two men succeeded in\nunderstanding each other. Glenarvan, fortunately, knew the habits of\nthe red wolf. Without this knowledge he could not have interpreted the\nwords and gestures of the Patagonian.\n\nNevertheless, a quarter of an hour passed before he could give to\nRobert the meaning of Thalcave's answer. He had questioned the Indian\nconcerning their situation.\n\n\"And what did he answer?\" inquired Robert.\n\n\"He said that, cost what it may, we must hold out till daybreak. The\naguara goes out only at night, and when morning comes he returns to\nhis lair. He is the wolf of darkness, a cowardly beast that fears the\ndaylight.\"\n\n\"Well, let us defend ourselves till day.\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy, and with our knives if we can no longer use our guns.\"\n\nAlready Thalcave had set the example, and when a wolf approached the\nfire, the long knife of the Patagonian was thrust through the flames\nand drawn back again red with blood.\n\nHowever, the means of defense were failing. About two o'clock in the\nmorning, Thalcave threw into the fire the last armful of fuel, and the\nbesieged had only five charges left.\n\nGlenarvan cast about him a sorrowful glance. He thought of the child\nwho was there, of his companions, of all whom he loved. Robert said\nnothing; perhaps the danger did not appear imminent to his hopeful\nspirit. But Glenarvan pictured to himself that terrible event, now\napparently inevitable, the being devoured alive! He was not master of\nhis emotion; he drew the child to his breast, he clasped him to his\nheart, he pressed his lips to his forehead, while tears flowed from his\neyes.\n\nRobert gazed at him with a smile. \"I am not afraid,\" said he.\n\n\"No, my boy, no,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and you are right. In two hours,\nday will appear, and we shall be saved! Well done, Thalcave, my brave\nPatagonian!\" cried he, as the Indian killed with the butt of his gun\ntwo enormous beasts that were attempting to cross the glowing barrier.\n\n[Sidenote: A DYING HOPE.]\n\nBut at this moment the dying light of the fire showed him the aguaras\nadvancing in a dense body to assail the ramada. The d\u00e9nouement of the\nbloody drama was approaching. The fire gradually subsided, for want\nof fuel; the flames sank; the plain, before illumined, now relapsed\ninto shadow, and in the shadow reappeared the terrible eyes of the red\nwolves. A few moments more, and the whole drove would rush into the\ninclosure.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThalcave discharged his carbine for the last time, stretched out one\nmore of their enemies, and, as his ammunition was exhausted, folded\nhis arms. His head sank upon his breast; he appeared to be questioning\nhimself. Was he searching for some bold, novel, or rash scheme for\nrepelling this furious herd? Glenarvan did not venture to ask him.\n\nAt this moment a change took place in the action of the wolves. They\nseemed to be retreating, and their howls, so deafening before, suddenly\nceased. An ominous silence reigned over the plain.\n\n\"They are going,\" said Robert.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Glenarvan, who was listening with intentness.\n\nBut Thalcave shook his head. He knew well that the animals would not\nabandon a certain prey until at daybreak they returned to their holes\nand dens.\n\nHowever, the tactics of their enemies had evidently changed, they no\nlonger endeavored to force the entrance of the ramada; but their new\nmanoeuvres were already causing a still more imminent danger.\n\nThe wolves, abandoning their design of penetrating the inclosure by\nthis entrance, which was defended by weapon and fire, went to the\nback of the ramada and sought to assail it in the rear. Their claws\nwere soon heard rattling against the half-decayed wood. Already their\npowerful paws and bloody mouths had forced their way between the\nshattered stakes. The horses, bewildered and panic-stricken, broke\ntheir halters and dashed into the inclosure. Glenarvan seized Robert\nin his arms, to defend him to the last extremity; and he would have\nattempted a rash flight, and rushed out of the ramada, had not his eyes\nfallen upon the Indian.\n\nThalcave, turning like a deer, had suddenly approached his horse,\nwhich was neighing with impatience, and was beginning to saddle him\ncarefully, forgetting neither strap nor buckle. He seemed no longer to\ncare for the howls, that were now redoubled. Glenarvan gazed at him\nwith a dark foreboding.\n\n\"He is leaving us!\" cried he, seeing Thalcave gather up his reins as\nthough he were about to mount.\n\n\"He? never!\" said Robert.\n\nIn truth the Indian was about to make a venture, not to leave his\nfriends, but to save them by sacrificing himself. Thaouka was ready.\nHe champed his bit; he pranced; his eyes, full of a fiery spirit, shot\nforth lightning flashes; he understood his master.\n\nJust as the Indian was seizing the mane of his horse, Glenarvan caught\nhim by the arm with a convulsive grasp.\n\n\"You are going?\" said he, pointing to the plain, which was now deserted.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Indian, who comprehended the gesture of his\ncompanion; and, with vehement gesticulations which were however\nperfectly intelligible, he added a few words in Spanish, which\nsignified: \"Thaouka--good horse--swift--will draw the wolves after him.\"\n\n[Illustration: Frightful howls resounded. The wolves, starting on the\ntrack of the horse, fled into the darkness with a terrible speed.]\n\n\"Ha! Thalcave!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Quick, quick!\" continued the Indian; while Glenarvan said to Robert,\nin a voice broken by emotion,--\n\n\"Robert, my lad, you hear! He will sacrifice himself for us; he will\nrush out over the plain, and turn aside the fury of the wolves upon\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Friend Thalcave,\" replied Robert, looking imploringly at the\nPatagonian, \"friend Thalcave, do not leave us!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Glenarvan, \"he will not leave us.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Indian, he added, pointing to the terrified horses\ncrowding against the stakes,--\n\n\"Let us go together.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Indian, who was not mistaken as to the meaning of these\nwords. \"Bad beasts--frightened--Thaouka--good horse.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave shall not leave, Robert. He\nshows me what I have to do. It is my duty to go, and his to remain with\nyou.\"\n\nThen, seizing Thaouka's bridle, he added,--\n\n\"I will go.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Patagonian, calmly.\n\n\"I tell you,\" cried Glenarvan, taking the bridle from the hands of the\nIndian, \"I will go. Save this boy! I trust him to you, Thalcave!\"\n\nGlenarvan, in his excitement, mingled English and Spanish together. But\nwhat matters the language? In such a terrible situation, signs tell\nall, and men quickly understand each other.\n\n[Sidenote: SAFETY FOR TWO.]\n\nHowever, Thalcave resisted, and the discussion was prolonged. The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back. Thaouka pranced,\nreared on his hind legs, and all at once, with a spring, cleared the\nbarrier of fire and the rampart of bodies, while a boyish voice cried,--\n\n\"God save you, my lord!\"\n\nGlenarvan and Thalcave had scarcely time to perceive Robert, who,\nclinging to the horse's mane, disappeared in the darkness.\n\n\"Robert, unfortunate!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nBut these words the Indian himself could not hear. Frightful howls\nresounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into\nthe darkness with a terrible speed.\n\nThalcave and Glenarvan rushed out of the ramada. Already the plain had\nresumed its tranquillity, and they could scarcely distinguish a moving\nline which undulated afar in the shadows of the night.\n\nGlenarvan sank upon the ground, overcome, in despair, clasping his\nhands. He gazed at Thalcave, who smiled with his accustomed calmness.\n\n\"Thaouka--good horse--brave child--he will be saved!\" he repeated,\nnodding his head.\n\n\"But if he falls?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"He will not fall!\"\n\nIn spite of Thalcave's confidence, his companion passed the night in\nterrible anguish. He was no longer even mindful of the danger still to\nbe feared from the wolves. He would have gone in search of Robert, but\nthe Indian restrained him, and explained that their horses could not\novertake the boy, that Thaouka must have distanced his enemies, and\ncould not be found in the darkness. They must wait for day to start in\nsearch of Robert.\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning day began to break. The mists of the\nhorizon were soon tinged with pale rays. A sparkling dew covered the\nplain, and the tall grass began to wave under the first breezes of the\ndawn.\n\nThe moment of departure had arrived.\n\n\"Forward!\" said the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come.", "\"Forward!\" said the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come.\n\nFor an hour they traveled thus with great speed, gazing around for\nRobert, and dreading at each step to behold his mangled body. Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.]\n\nTo Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master.\n\n\"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.\n\nThen it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\"\n\nThe Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal. Then, turning\ntowards Paganel, he pointed to young Robert.\n\n\"A brave boy!\" said he.\n\nGlenarvan, however, asked, even while he admired the lad,--\n\n\"Why, my son, did you not let Thalcave or me try this last chance of\nsaving you?\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied he, in accents of the liveliest gratitude, \"was it\nnot my duty to sacrifice myself, when Thalcave has saved my life, and\nyou are going to save my father?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nSTRANGE SIGNS.\n\n\nAfter their first outbursts of joy at meeting were over, Paganel,\nAustin, Wilson, and Mulready--all who had remained behind, except the\nmajor--were conscious of one thing, namely, that they were suffering\nfrom thirst. Fortunately, the Guamini flowed at no great distance.\nThey accordingly continued their journey, and at seven o'clock in the\nmorning the little party arrived at the ramada. On seeing its entrance\nstrewn with the bodies of the wolves, it was easy to understand the\nviolence of the attack and the vigor of the defense. The travelers,\nafter fully quenching their thirst, devoted their attention to\nbreakfast in the inclosure. The ostrich-steaks were declared excellent,\nand the armadillo, roasted in its own covering, was a delicious dish.\n\n\"To eat reasonably of this,\" said Paganel, \"would be ingratitude\ntowards Providence. We really must eat immoderately.\"\n\nAnd he did so accordingly,--but was not sick, thanks to the clear water\nof the Guamini, which appeared to possess superior digestive properties.\n\n[Sidenote: AEROSTATIC EXPERIMENTS.]\n\nAt ten o'clock Glenarvan gave the signal for departure. The\nwater-bottles were filled, and they set out. The horses, being greatly\nrevived, evinced much spirit, and maintained an easy and almost\ncontinuous canter. The next morning they crossed the boundary which\nseparates the Argentine Plains from the Pampas. Here Thalcave hoped\nto meet the chiefs in whose hands he doubted not that he should find\nHarry Grant and rescue him and his two companions from slavery.\n\nSince they had left the Guamini, the travelers noticed, with great\nsatisfaction, a considerable change in the temperature, thanks to the\ncold winds of Patagonia, which cause continual currents of air. Neither\nman nor beast had any reason to complain, after suffering so much from\ndryness and heat. They therefore pushed on with courage and confidence.\nBut, whatever might have been said, the country seemed to be entirely\nuninhabited, or, to use a more exact word, \"disinhabited.\"\n\nFrequently they skirted the shores of fresh-water lagoons, on whose\nbanks, in the shelter of the bushes, tiny wrens skipped and melodious\nlarks warbled, in company with the brilliant-plumaged tanagers. These\npretty birds gayly fluttered about, heedless of the haughty starlings\nthat strutted on the banks like soldiers with their epaulettes and red\nbreasts. In the thorny coppices the nests of the annubis swung like\nhammocks, and on the shores of the lagoons magnificent flamingoes,\nmarching in regular file, spread their fiery-colored wings to the wind.\nTheir nests were seen, by thousands together, like a small village, in\nthe shape of truncated cones a foot high. The birds were not startled\nat the approach of the travelers, which was contrary to Paganel's\ncalculations.\n\n\"I have been curious for a long time,\" said he to the major, \"to see a\nflamingo fly.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said MacNabb.\n\n\"Now, since I have an opportunity, I shall profit by it.\"\n\n\"Do so, Paganel.\"\n\n\"Come with me, major, and you too, Robert; I need witnesses.\"\n\nAnd Paganel, leaving his companions to go on, proceeded towards the\nflock of flamingoes, followed by Robert and the major. Arriving within\nrange, Paganel fired a blank charge (for he would not needlessly\ndestroy even a bird), and all the flamingoes flew away, while the\ngeographer gazed at them attentively through his glasses.\n\n\"Well,\" said he to the major, when the flock had disappeared, \"did you\nsee them fly?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied MacNabb; \"you could not do otherwise, unless you\nwere blind. But let us hasten on, for we have fallen a mile behind.\"\n\nWhen he had joined his companions, Paganel found Glenarvan in excited\nconversation with the Indian, whom he did not appear to understand.\nThalcave had frequently stopped to examine the horizon, and each time\nhis countenance expressed a lively astonishment. Glenarvan, not seeing\nhis ordinary interpreter present, had attempted, but in vain, to\nquestion the Patagonian. So, as soon as he perceived the geographer at\na distance, he cried,--\n\n\"Come, friend Paganel, Thalcave and I can scarcely succeed in\nunderstanding each other.\"\n\nPaganel conversed a few moments with the Indian, and, turning to\nGlenarvan, said,--\n\n\"Thalcave is astonished at a circumstance that is really strange.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"At meeting neither Indians, nor any traces of them, on these plains,\nwhich are usually furrowed with their trails, whether they are driving\nhome the cattle stolen from the ranchos, or going to the Andes to sell\ntheir zorillo carpets and whips of braided leather.\"\n\n\"And to what does Thalcave attribute this abandonment?\"\n\n\"He cannot tell; he is astonished. That is all.\"\n\n\"But what Indians did he expect to find in this part of the Pampas?\"\n\n\"The very ones who have had foreign prisoners; those natives who are\ncommanded by the caziques Calfoucoura, Catriel, and Yanchetruz.\"\n\n\"Who are these caziques?\"\n\n[Illustration: Arriving within range, Paganel fired a blank charge (for\nhe would not needlessly destroy even a bird), and all the flamingoes\nflew away, while the geographer gazed at them attentively through his\nglasses.]\n\n\"Chiefs of tribes that were very powerful thirty years ago, before they\nwere driven beyond the sierras. Since that time they have been subdued\nas much as an Indian can be, and now scour the Pampas as well as the\nprovince of Buenos Ayres. I am therefore astonished, like Thalcave,\nat not encountering traces of them in a country where they generally\npursue the calling of plunderers.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" inquired Glenarvan, \"what course ought we to take?\"\n\n\"I will see,\" replied Paganel.\n\nAfter a few moments' conversation with Thalcave, he said,--\n\n\"This is his advice, which seems to me very wise. We must continue our\njourney to the east as far as Fort Independence; and there, if we have\nno news of Captain Grant, we shall at least know what has become of the\nIndians of the plain.\"\n\n\"Is Fort Independence far?\"\n\n\"No; it is situated at Tandil, sixty miles distant.\"\n\n\"And when shall we arrive there?\"\n\n\"On the evening of the day after to-morrow.\"\n\nGlenarvan was quite disconcerted at finding no Indians on the Pampas,\na circumstance which was little expected. There are ordinarily too\nmany of them. Some special cause must therefore have removed them.\nBut a serious question was to be considered. If Captain Grant was a\nprisoner of one of these tribes, had he been carried to the north or\nto the south? This problem harassed Glenarvan. It was advisable at all\nhazards to keep track of the captain. In short, it was better to follow\nThalcave's advice and reach the village of Tandil, where at least they\ncould obtain information.\n\nAbout four o'clock in the afternoon they approached a hill that might\nhave passed for a mountain in so level a country. It was Tapalquem\nSierra, and at its foot the travelers encamped for the night.\n\n[Sidenote: GALLOPING GAUCHOS.]\n\nThe passage of this mountain was accomplished the next day with the\ngreatest ease. They followed the sandy undulations of a gradually\nsloping terrace, which certainly did not present difficulties to\npeople who had scaled the Andes, and the horses scarcely relaxed their\nrapid pace. At noon they reached the abandoned Fort Tapalquem, the\nfirst of the chain of forts built on the southern frontier against the\nplundering natives. But not a shadow of an Indian did they encounter,\nto the increasing surprise of Thalcave; although, towards the middle of\nthe day, three rovers of the plain, well armed and mounted, gazed for\na moment at the little party, but prevented their approach, galloping\naway with incredible rapidity. Glenarvan was furious.\n\n\"Gauchos,\" said the Patagonian.\n\n\"Ah! Gauchos,\" replied MacNabb. \"Well, Paganel, what do you think of\nthese creatures?\"\n\n\"I think they look like famous bandits,\" answered Paganel.\n\n\"And hence of course are, my dear geographer?\"\n\n\"Of course, my dear major.\"\n\nPaganel's avowal was followed by a general laugh, which did not\ndisconcert him at all.", "\"And hence of course are, my dear geographer?\"\n\n\"Of course, my dear major.\"\n\nPaganel's avowal was followed by a general laugh, which did not\ndisconcert him at all.\n\nAccording to Thalcave's orders, they advanced in close ranks, and\nat evening encamped in a spacious abandoned rancho, where the chief\nCatriel generally assembled his bands of natives. From an examination\nof the ground and the absence of fresh tracks, the Patagonian knew that\nit had not been occupied for a long time.\n\nThe next morning Glenarvan and his companions found themselves again\non the plain. The first estancias (vast establishments for raising\ncattle), which border upon the Tandil, were descried; but Thalcave\nresolved not to stop, but to keep straight on to Fort Independence,\nwhere he wished to obtain information, especially concerning the\nsingular condition of this abandoned country.\n\nThe trees, so rare since leaving the Andes, now reappeared. The greater\npart of these have been planted since the arrival of the Europeans\non the American continent. They generally surround \"corrals,\" vast\ncattle-inclosures protected with stakes. Here thousands of cattle,\nsheep, cows, and horses, branded with the mark of the owner, graze\nand fatten, while large numbers of huge dogs keep watch. The soil is\nadmirably adapted to raising cattle, and yields an excellent fodder.\n\nThe people lead the life of the shepherds of the Bible. Their flocks\nare perhaps even more numerous than those which fed on the plains of\nMesopotamia; but the family element is wanting, and the owners of the\ngreat folds of the Pampas have little to recommend themselves or their\nmanner of life.\n\nPaganel explained all these particulars to his companions, and even\nsucceeded in interesting the major.\n\nThalcave, meanwhile, hastened their progress, as he wished to arrive\nthat evening at Fort Independence. The horses, urged on by their\nmasters, and following the example of Thaouka, dashed through the\ntall grass. They passed several farms, fortified and defended by deep\nditches. The principal house was provided with an elevated terrace,\nfrom which the inmates could fire upon the plunderers of the plain.\nGlenarvan might perhaps have obtained here the information that he\nsought; but it was wisest to go to the village of Tandil. They did not\nstop, therefore, and soon the feet of the horses struck the grassy\nsward of the first mountain slopes. An hour afterward the village\nappeared at the bottom of a narrow gorge crowned by the embattled walls\nof Fort Independence.\n\n[Illustration: In fact, they were a dozen young children and boys who\nwere drilling very nicely. Their uniform consisted of a striped shirt\nconfined at the waist by a leathern girdle.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nA FALSE TRAIL.\n\n\nPaganel, after giving his companions a brief account of the village of\nTandil, added that they could not fail to obtain information there;\nmoreover, the fort was always garrisoned by a detachment of national\ntroops. Glenarvan, accordingly, put the horses into the stable of a\n\"fonda;\" and Paganel, the major, Robert, and he, under the guidance of\nThalcave, proceeded towards Fort Independence.\n\nAfter ascending the ridges of the mountains for a short time, they\narrived at the postern, rather carelessly guarded by a native sentinel.\nThey passed without difficulty, and inferred either great negligence or\nextreme security. A few soldiers were exercising on the parade-ground\nof the fort, the oldest of whom was not more than twenty and the\nyoungest scarcely ten. In fact, they were a dozen young children and\nboys who were drilling very nicely. Their uniform consisted of a\nstriped shirt confined at the waist by a leathern girdle. The mildness\nof the climate justified this light costume. Each of these young\nsoldiers carried a gun and a sword, which were too long and heavy for\nthe little fellows. All had a certain family resemblance, and the\ncorporal who commanded resembled them too: they were twelve brothers,\nwho were parading under the orders of the thirteenth.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ARGENTINE COMMANDANT.]\n\nPaganel was not astonished. He remembered his Argentine statistics, and\nknew that in this country the average number of children in a family\nexceeds nine. But what surprised him exceedingly was to see these\nlittle soldiers practicing the French tactics, and to hear the orders\nof the corporal given in his own native language.\n\n\"This is singular,\" said he.\n\nBut Glenarvan had not come to see boys drill, still less to occupy\nhimself with their nationality or relationship. He did not, therefore,\ngive Paganel time to express further astonishment, but besought him\nto ask for the commander of the fortress. Paganel did so, and one of\nthe soldiers proceeded towards a small building which served as the\nbarracks.\n\nA few moments after, the commander appeared in person. He was a man\nof fifty, robust, with a military air, thick whiskers, prominent\ncheek-bones, gray hair, and commanding look, so far as one could judge\nthrough the clouds of smoke that issued from his short pipe.\n\nThalcave, addressing him, introduced Lord Glenarvan and his companions.\nWhile he spoke, the commander kept scrutinizing Paganel with quite\nembarrassing persistence. The geographer did not know what the trooper\nmeant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized\nhis hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,--\n\n\"A Frenchman?\"\n\n\"Yes, a Frenchman,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\"\ncried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful\nviolence.\n\n\"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts\nof the world!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! Jos\u00e9!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\"\n\nManuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, at length.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope.\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS.]\n\nPaganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant.\n\n\"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks.\n\n\"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\"", "\"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks.\n\n\"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\"\n\n\"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken. The date of the\nshipwreck is definite. The Britannia was lost in June, 1862, less than\ntwo years ago.\"\n\n\"Oh, more than that, my lord!\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Not at all. It was when Pepe was born. There were two men.\"\n\n\"No, three!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Two,\" replied the sergeant, in a positive tone.\n\n\"Two?\" exclaimed Glenarvan, very much chagrined. \"Two Englishmen?\"\n\n\"No,\" continued the sergeant. \"Who speaks of Englishmen? It was a\nFrenchman and an Italian.\"\n\n\"An Italian who was massacred by the Indians?\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, and I learned afterwards--Frenchman saved.\"\n\n\"Saved!\" exclaimed Robert, whose very life seemed to hang on the\nsergeant's lips.\n\n\"Yes, saved from the hands of the Indians,\" replied Manuel.\n\nEach looked to the geographer, who beat his brow in despair.\n\n\"Ah! I understand,\" said he, at last. \"All is clear, all is explained.\"\n\n\"But what is to be done?\" asked Glenarvan, with as much anxiety as\nimpatience.\n\n\"My friends,\" answered Paganel, taking Robert's hands, \"we must submit\nto a severe misfortune. We have followed a false trail! The captive\nin question is not the captain, but one of my countrymen (whose\ncompanion, Marco Vazello, was actually assassinated by the Indians),\na Frenchman who often accompanied these cruel savages to the banks of\nthe Colorado, and who, after fortunately escaping from their hands,\nreturned to France. While thinking that we were on the track of Captain\nGrant, we have fallen upon that of young Guinnard.\"\n\nA profound silence followed this declaration. The mistake was palpable.\nThe sergeant's story, the nationality of the prisoner, the murder\nof his companion, and his escape from the hands of the Indians, all\naccorded with the evident facts. Glenarvan gazed at Thalcave with a\nbewildered air. The Indian then resumed the conversation.\n\n\"Have you never heard of three English captives?\" he asked the sergeant.\n\n\"Never,\" replied Manuel. \"It would have been known at Tandil. I should\nhave heard of it. No, it cannot be.\"\n\nGlenarvan, after this formal response, had nothing more to do at Fort\nIndependence. He and his friends, therefore, departed, not without\nthanking the sergeant and shaking hands with him.\n\nGlenarvan was in despair at this complete overthrow of his hopes.\nRobert walked beside him in silence, with tearful eyes, while his\nprotector could not find a single word to console him. Paganel\ngesticulated and talked to himself. The major did not open his lips.\nAs for Thalcave, his Indian pride seemed humbled at having gone astray\non a false trail. No one, however, thought of reproaching him for so\nexcusable an error.\n\nThey returned to the encampment, saddened indeed. Still, not one of\nthe courageous and devoted men regretted so many hardships uselessly\nendured, so many dangers vainly incurred. But each saw all hope of\nsuccess annihilated in an instant. Could they find Captain Grant\nbetween Tandil and the sea? No. If any prisoner had fallen into the\nhands of the Indians on the Atlantic coast, Sergeant Manuel would\ncertainly have been informed. An event of such a nature could not\nhave escaped the natives who trade from Tandil to Carmen. Among the\ntraders of the Argentine Plains everything is known and reported. There\nwas therefore but one course now to take,--to join, without delay, the\nDuncan at Cape Medano, the appointed rendezvous.\n\n[Illustration: More than once during the journey, the attention and\ninterest of all, but especially of Paganel, were arrested by the\ncurious illusion of the mirage.]\n\nIn the meantime, Paganel had asked Glenarvan for the document, by\nrelying on which their search had resulted so unfortunately. He\nread it again with unconcealed vexation, seeking to discover a new\ninterpretation.\n\n\"This document is, at all events, clear,\" said Glenarvan. \"It explains\nin the most definite manner the shipwreck of the captain and the place\nof his captivity.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the geographer, stamping with his foot, \"a hundred times\nno! Since Captain Grant is not on the Pampas, he is not in America.\nThis document ought to tell where he is; and it shall, my friends, or I\nam no longer Jacques Paganel.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nTHE FLOOD.\n\n\n[Sidenote: OMENS AND MIRAGES.]\n\nFort Independence is one hundred and fifty miles from the shores of\nthe Atlantic. But for unforeseen and unexpected delays, Glenarvan\ncould have rejoined the Duncan in four days. He could not, however,\nreconcile himself to the idea of returning on board without Captain\nGrant, and failing so completely in his search; and did not therefore,\nas usual, give the orders for departure. But the major assumed the\ntask of saddling the horses, renewing the provisions, and making his\narrangements for the journey. Thanks to his activity, the little party,\nat eight o'clock in the morning, was on its way down the grassy slopes\nof the Tandil Sierra.\n\nGlenarvan, with Robert at his side, galloped on in silence. His\nlordship's bold and resolute character did not permit him to accept\nthis disappointment calmly. His heart beat violently, and his brain was\non fire. Paganel, tormented by the mystery of the document, arranged\nthe words in every way, as if to draw from them a new meaning. Thalcave\nsilently resigned himself to Thaouka's sagacity. The major, always\nconfident, performed his duties like a man upon whom discouragement can\nhave no effect. Tom Austin and his two sailors shared their master's\nannoyance. Once, when a timid hare crossed the path in front of them,\nthe superstitious Scotchmen gazed at one another.\n\n\"A bad omen,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"Yes, in the Highlands,\" replied Mulready.\n\n\"What is bad in the Highlands is no better here,\" added Wilson,\nsententiously.\n\nAbout noon the travelers had descended the mountains and gained the\nundulating plains that extend to the sea; the boundless prairie spread\nits broad carpet of verdure before them.\n\nMore than once during the journey the attention and interest of all,\nbut especially of Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of\nthe mirage, by which was presented in the sky, at the limits of the\nhorizon, a semblance of the estancias, the poplars and willows near\nthem, and other objects; the images being so much like the reality that\nit required a strong effort to realize their deceptive character.\n\nThe weather hitherto had been fine, but now the sky assumed a less\npleasing aspect. Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to\ndissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic,\nand the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of\nthis region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"ca\u00f1ada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for\ntents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all.\n\nThe next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean\nstreams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every\ndepression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already\ndeep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the\nhorses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous\nswamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it was\nnecessary to incur the danger before it could be understood. These\nquagmires had been already fatal to more than one human being.\n\nRobert, who had ridden half a mile in advance, returned at a gallop,\ncrying,--\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel! Monsieur Paganel! A forest of horns!\"\n\n\"What!\" replied the geographer, \"have you found a forest of horns?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; or at least a field.\"\n\n\"A field! you are dreaming, my boy,\" said Paganel, shrugging his\nshoulders.\n\n\"I am not dreaming,\" retorted Robert; \"you shall see for yourself. This\nis a strange country! People sow horns, and they spring up like corn! I\nshould like very well to have some of the seed.\"\n\n\"But he speaks seriously,\" said the major.\n\n\"Yes, major, you shall see.\"\n\nRobert was not mistaken, and soon they found themselves before a vast\nfield of horns, regularly planted.\n\n\"Well?\" said Robert.\n\n\"This is something singular,\" replied Paganel, turning towards the\nIndian with a questioning look.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ANXIOUS INDIAN.]\n\n\"The horns come from the ground,\" explained Thalcave; \"and the cattle\nare under it.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Paganel, \"is there a whole drove in this mire?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Patagonian.\n\nIn fact, a vast herd had perished in this bog, which had given way\nbeneath them. Hundreds of cattle had thus met their death, side by\nside, by suffocation in this vast quagmire. This circumstance, which\nsometimes takes place on the plains, could not be ignored by the\nIndian, and it was a warning which it was proper to heed. They passed\naround this immense hecatomb, which would have satisfied the most\nexacting gods of antiquity; and an hour after the field of horns was\nfar behind.\n\nThalcave now began to observe with an anxious air the state of things\naround him. He frequently stopped, and rose in his stirrups. His tall\nform enabled him to survey a wide range; but, perceiving nothing that\ncould enlighten him, he resumed his undeviating course. A mile farther,\nhe stopped again, and, turning from the beaten track, proceeded a short\ndistance, first to the north, then to the south, and then resumed his\nplace at the head of the party, without saying either what he hoped or\nwhat he feared.", "These manoeuvres, many times repeated, puzzled Paganel and annoyed\nGlenarvan. The geographer was accordingly requested to interrogate\nthe Indian, which he did at once. Thalcave replied that he was\nastonished to see the plain so soaked with moisture. Never within his\nrecollection, since he had performed the office of guide, had his feet\ntrodden a soil so saturated. Even in the season of the great rains the\nArgentine plain was always easily passed.\n\n\"But to what do you attribute this increasing moisture?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"I know not,\" replied the Indian; \"and what if I did?\"\n\n\"Do the mountain streams, when swollen with the rains, ever overflow\ntheir banks?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"And now, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Thalcave.\n\nPaganel was forced to be contented with this answer, and communicated\nto Glenarvan the result of the conversation.\n\n\"And what does Thalcave advise?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" asked Paganel of the Patagonian.\n\n\"Advance quickly,\" replied the Indian.\n\nThis advice was easier to give than to follow. The horses were quickly\nfatigued with treading a soil that sank beneath them deeper and deeper\nas they progressed, so that this part of the plain might have been\ncompared to an immense basin in which the invading waters would rapidly\naccumulate. It was advisable, therefore, to cross without delay these\nsloping terraces that an inundation would have instantly transformed\ninto a lake.\n\nThey hastened their pace, though there was no great depth to the water\nwhich spread out in a sheet beneath the horses' feet. About two o'clock\nthe flood-gates of the heavens opened, and tropical torrents of rain\ndescended. Never was a finer opportunity presented for showing oneself\na philosopher. There was no chance of escaping this deluge, and it was\nbetter for the travelers to receive it stoically. Their ponchos were\nsoon dripping, and their hats wet them still more, like roofs whose\ngutters have overflowed. The fringes of the saddle-cloths seemed so\nmany liquid streams; and the horsemen, bespattered by their animals,\nwhose hoofs splashed in the water at every step, rode in a double\nshower, which came from the ground as well as the sky.\n\n[Sidenote: HYDROPATHIC TREATMENT.]\n\nIt was in this wretchedly cold and exhausted state that they arrived,\ntowards evening, at a very miserable rancho. Only people who were not\nfastidious could have given it the name of a shelter, only travelers in\ndistress would consent to occupy it. But Glenarvan and his companions\nhad no choice. They therefore cowered down in the abandoned hut which\nwould not have satisfied even a poor Indian of the plains. A sorry\nfire of grass, which gave out more smoke than heat, was kindled with\ndifficulty. The torrents of rain made havoc without, and large drops\noozed through the mouldy thatch. The fire was extinguished twenty\ntimes, and twenty times did Wilson and Mulready struggle against the\ninvading water.\n\nThe supper was very meagre and comfortless, and every one's appetite\nfailed. The major alone did justice to the water-soaked repast, and did\nnot lose a mouthful: he was superior to misfortune. As for Paganel,\nlike a Frenchman, he tried to joke; but now he failed.\n\n\"My jokes are wet,\" said he: \"they miss fire.\"\n\nHowever, as it was more agreeable--if possible, under the\ncircumstances--to sleep, each one sought in slumber a temporary\nforgetfulness of his fatigues.\n\nThe night was stormy. The sides of the rancho cracked as if they would\nbreak, while the frail structure bent beneath the gusts of wind and\nthreatened to give way at every shock. The unfortunate horses neighed\nin terror without, exposed to the inclemency of the tempest; and their\nmasters did not suffer less in their miserable shelter. However, sleep\ndrowned all their troubles at last. Robert first closed his eyes,\nreclining his head on Lord Glenarvan's shoulder; and soon all the\ninmates of the rancho slept under the protection of God.\n\nThey woke the next morning at the call of Thaouka, who, always ready,\nneighed without, and struck the wall of the hut vigorously with his\nhoof, as though to give the signal for departure. They owed him too\nmuch not to obey him, and they accordingly resumed their journey.\n\nThe rain had ceased, but the hard earth held what had fallen. On the\nimpenetrable clay, pools, marshes, and ponds overflowed and formed\nimmense \"ba\u00f1ados\" of treacherous depth. Paganel, on consulting his map,\njudged rightly that the Grande and Nivarota Rivers, into which the\nwaters of the plain usually flow, must have mingled together in one\nbroad stream.\n\nAn extremely rapid advance, therefore, became necessary. The common\nsafety was at stake. If the inundation increased, where could they find\na refuge? The vast circle of the horizon did not offer a single point,\nand on this level plain the progress of the water must be rapid. The\nhorses were urged to their utmost speed. Thaouka took the lead, and\nmight have borne the name of sea-horse, for he pranced as if he had\nbeen in his native element.\n\nSuddenly, about six o'clock in the evening, he manifested signs of\nextreme agitation. He turned frequently towards the vast expanse to the\nsouth; his neighs were prolonged, his nostrils keenly snuffed the air,\nand he reared violently. Thalcave, whom his antics could not unseat,\nmanaged his steed without difficulty. The froth from the horse's mouth\nwas mingled with blood under the action of the firmly-closed bit, and\nyet the spirited animal could not be calm. If free, his master felt but\ntoo well that he would have fled away at full speed towards the north.\n\n\"What is the matter with Thaouka?\" asked Paganel. \"Has he been bitten\nby those voracious blood-suckers of the Argentine waters?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Indian.\n\n\"Is he terrified, then, at some danger?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has scented danger.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\nAlthough the eye did not yet reveal the peril that Thaouka divined,\nthe ear could already detect it. A low murmur, like the sound of a\nrising tide, was heard as from the limit of the horizon. The wind blew\nin damp gusts laden with spray; the birds, as if fleeing from some\nunknown phenomenon, shot swiftly through the air; and the horses,\nwading to their knees, felt the first impulse of the current. Soon a\nmingled roar, like bellowing, neighing, and bleating, resounded half\na mile to the south, and immense herds appeared, tumbling, rising,\nand rushing, a confused mass of terrified beasts, and fled by with\nfrightful rapidity. It was scarcely possible to distinguish them in the\nmidst of the clouds of spray dashed up by their flight.\n\n[Illustration: \"The flood! the flood!\" replied Thalcave, spurring his\nhorse towards the north.]\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave, in a piercing voice.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Paganel.\n\n\"The flood! the flood!\" replied Thalcave, spurring his horse towards\nthe north.\n\n\"The inundation!\" cried Paganel; and his companions, with him at their\nhead, fled away in the track of Thaouka.\n\nIt was time. Five miles to the south a high and broad wall of water\nwas rushing over the plain, which was fast becoming an ocean. The tall\ngrass disappeared as before the scythe, and the tufts of mimosas, torn\nup by the current, separated and formed floating islands. The mass of\nwaters spread itself in broad waves of irresistible power. The dikes of\nthe great rivers had evidently given way, and perhaps the waters of the\nColorado and Rio Negro were now mingling in a common stream.\n\nThe wall of water descried by Thalcave advanced with the speed of a\nrace-horse. The travelers fled before it like a cloud driven by the\nstorm. Their eyes sought in vain a place of refuge. Sky and water\nmingled together on the horizon. The horses, excited by the danger,\ndashed along in a mad gallop, so that their riders could scarcely keep\ntheir seats. Glenarvan frequently glanced behind him.\n\n\"The water is overtaking us,\" he thought.\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave.\n\n[Sidenote: THE ARK.]\n\nThe unfortunate beasts were urged to a swifter pace. From their flanks,\nlacerated with the spur, flowed bright red streams, which marked\ntheir course on the water by long, crimson lines. They stumbled in\nthe hollows of the ground; they were entangled in the hidden grass;\nthey fell and rose again continually. The depth of the water sensibly\nincreased. Long surges announced the on-rush of the mass of water that\ntossed its foaming crests less than two miles distant.\n\nFor a quarter of an hour this final struggle against the most terrible\nof elements was prolonged. The fugitives could keep no account of the\ndistance they had traversed; but, judging by the rapidity of their\nflight, it must have been considerable.\n\nMeantime the horses, immersed to their breasts, could no longer\nadvance without extreme difficulty. Glenarvan, Paganel, Austin, all\nbelieved themselves lost, victims of the horrible death of unfortunates\nabandoned at sea. Their animals began to lose their footing; six feet\nof water was sufficient to drown them.\n\nWe must forbear to picture the acute anguish of these eight men\novertaken by a rising inundation. They felt their powerlessness to\nstruggle against these convulsions of nature, superior to human\nstrength. Their safety was no longer in their own hands.\n\nFive minutes after, the horses were swimming, while the current alone\ncarried them along with irresistible force and furious swiftness. All\nsafety seemed impossible, when the voice of the major was heard.\n\n\"A tree!\" said he.\n\n\"A tree!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, yonder!\" replied Thalcave, and he pointed northward to a kind of\ngigantic walnut-tree, which rose solitary from the midst of the waters.\n\nHis companions had no need to be urged. This tree that was opportunely\npresented to them they must reach at all hazards. The horses probably\ncould not accomplish the distance; but the men, at least, could be\nsaved,--the current would carry them.\n\nAt that moment Tom Austin's horse gave a stifled neigh and disappeared.\nHis rider, extricating himself from the stirrups, began to swim\nvigorously.", "At that moment Tom Austin's horse gave a stifled neigh and disappeared.\nHis rider, extricating himself from the stirrups, began to swim\nvigorously.\n\n\"Cling to my saddle!\" cried Glenarvan to him.\n\n\"Thanks, my lord,\" replied he, \"my arms are strong.\"\n\n\"Your horse, Robert?\" continued Glenarvan, turning towards the boy.\n\n\"All right, my lord, all right! He swims like a fish.\"\n\n\"Attention!\" cried the major, in a loud voice.\n\nThis word was scarcely pronounced, when the enormous wall of water\nreached them. A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide. When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other.\n\n\"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not sorry for? No one ever knew; for the poor man was\nforced to swallow the end of his sentence in half a pint of muddy water.\n\nThe major calmly advanced, taking a regular stroke of which the most\nskillful swimmer would not have been ashamed. The sailors worked their\nway along like porpoises in their native element. As for Robert, he\nclung to Thaouka's mane, and was thus drawn along. The horse proudly\ncut the waters, and kept himself instinctively on a line with the tree,\ntowards which the current bore him, and which was now not far distant.\n\nIn a few moments the entire party reached it. It was fortunate; for, if\nthis refuge had failed, all chance of safety would have vanished, and\nthey must have perished in the waves. The water was up to the top of\nthe trunk where the main branches grew, so that it was easy to grasp\nthem.\n\nThalcave, leaving his horse, and lifting Robert, seized the first limb,\nand soon his powerful arms had lodged the exhausted swimmers in a place\nof safety. But Thaouka, carried away by the current, was rapidly\ndisappearing. He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and,\nshaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly.\n\n[Illustration: A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide.]\n\n\"Do you abandon him?\" said Paganel.\n\n\"I?\" cried the Indian, and, plunging into the tempestuous waters, he\nreappeared some distance from the tree. A few moments after, his arm\nrested upon the neck of Thaouka, and horse and horseman swam away\ntogether towards the misty horizon of the north.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nA SINGULAR ABODE.\n\n\nThe tree upon which Glenarvan and his companions had just found refuge\nresembled a walnut-tree. It had the same shining foliage and rounded\nform. It was the \"ombu,\" which is met with only on the Argentine\nPlains. It had an enormous, twisted trunk, and was confined to the\nearth not only by its great roots, but also by strong shoots which held\nit most tenaciously. It had thus resisted the force of the inundation.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ORNITHOLOGICAL OMNIUM-GATHERUM.]\n\nThis ombu measured one hundred feet in height, and might have covered\nwith its shade a circumference of three hundred and sixty feet. All\nthe upper part rested on three great branches, which forked from the\ntop of the trunk, that was six feet in diameter. Two of these branches\nwere nearly perpendicular, and supported the immense canopy of foliage,\nwhose crossed, twisted, and interlaced limbs, as if woven by the hand\nof a basket-maker, formed an impenetrable shelter. The third branch,\non the contrary, extended almost horizontally over the roaring waters;\nits leaves were bathed in them, while it seemed a promontory to this\nisland of verdure surrounded by an ocean. There was abundant space,\nalso, in the interior of this gigantic tree. The foliage, which was\nnot very dense at its outer circumference, left large openings like\nsky-lights, and made it well ventilated and cool. At sight of these\nbranches rising in innumerable ramifications towards the clouds, while\nthe parasitic convolvuli bound them to each other, and the rays of the\nsun shone through the interstices of the leaves, you would really have\nthought that the trunk of this ombu bore upon itself alone an entire\nforest.\n\nOn the arrival of the fugitives, a feathered population flew away to\nthe top branches, protesting by their cries against so flagrant a\nusurpation of their dwelling. These birds, that had themselves sought\nrefuge upon this solitary ombu, were seen by hundreds,--blackbirds,\nstarlings, and many other richly-feathered varieties; and when they\nflew away it seemed as if a gust of wind had stripped the tree of its\nleaves.\n\nSuch was the asylum offered to Glenarvan's little party. Robert and the\nnimble Wilson were scarcely perched in the tree, before they hastened\nto climb to the topmost branches. Their heads protruded above the dome\nof verdure. From this lofty position the view embraced a wide range.\nThe ocean created by the inundation surrounded them on all sides,\nand their eyes could discern no limit. No other tree emerged from\nthe watery surface; the ombu, alone in the midst of the unconfined\nwaters, groaned at every shock. At a distance, borne along by the\nimpetuous current, floated uprooted trunks, twisted branches, thatch\ntorn from some demolished rancho, beams swept by the waters from the\nroofs of cattle-folds, bodies of drowned animals, bloody skins, and,\non a swaying tree, a whole family of growling jaguars that clung with\ntheir claws to this fragile raft. Still farther off, a black speck\nalmost invisible attracted Wilson's attention. It was Thalcave and his\nfaithful Thaouka, disappearing in the distance.\n\n[Illustration: He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and,\nshaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly.]\n\n[Sidenote: A COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY.]\n\n\"Thalcave, friend Thalcave!\" cried Robert, stretching out his hands\ntowards the courageous Patagonian.\n\n\"He will be saved, Mr. Robert,\" said Wilson; \"but let us join Lord\nGlenarvan.\"\n\nA moment after, Robert and the sailor descended the three stories\nof branches and found themselves among their companions. Glenarvan,\nPaganel, the major, Austin, and Mulready were seated astraddle, or\ndangling in the branches, according to their own inclinations. Wilson\ngave an account of their visit to the top of the tree. All shared his\nopinion in regard to Thalcave. The only question was, whether Thalcave\nwould save Thaouka, or Thaouka Thalcave.\n\nThe present situation of these refugees was undeniably insecure. The\ntree would not probably give way to the force of the current, but the\nrising waters might reach the top branches, for the depression of\nthe soil made this part of the plain a deep reservoir. Glenarvan's\nfirst care, therefore, was to establish, by means of notches, points\nof comparison which enabled him to note the different heights of the\nwater. The flood was now stationary, and it appeared to have reached\nits greatest elevation. This was encouraging.\n\n\"And now what shall we do?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Build our nest, of course,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Build our nest!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Certainly, my boy, and live the life of birds, since we cannot live\nthe life of fishes.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Glenarvan; \"but who will give us our beakful?\"\n\n\"I,\" replied the major.\n\nAll eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who was comfortably seated in a\nnatural arm-chair formed of two pliant branches, and with one hand was\nholding out the wet though well-filled saddle-bags.\n\n\"Ah, MacNabb,\" cried Glenarvan, \"this is just like you! You think of\neverything, even under circumstances where it is allowable to forget.\"\n\n\"As soon as it was decided not to be drowned, I concluded not to die of\nhunger.\"\n\n\"I should not have thought of this,\" said Paganel, innocently; \"but I\nam so absent-minded!\"\n\n\"And what do the saddle-bags contain?\" inquired Tom Austin.\n\n\"Provisions for seven men for two days,\" replied MacNabb.\n\n\"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"I hope that the inundation will be\nconsiderably lower twenty-four hours hence.\"\n\n\"Or that we shall find some means of gaining _terra firma_,\" added\nPaganel.\n\n\"Our first business, then, is to breakfast,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"After drying ourselves,\" observed the major.\n\n\"And fire?\" said Wilson.\n\n\"Why, we must make one,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"At the top of the trunk, of course.\"\n\n\"With what?\"\n\n\"With dead wood that we shall cut in the tree.\"\n\n\"But how kindle it?\" said Glenarvan. \"Our tinder is like a wet sponge.\"\n\n\"We will manage that,\" answered Paganel; \"a little dry moss, a ray of\nsunlight, the lens of my telescope, and you will see by what a fire I\nwill dry myself. Who will go for wood in the forest?\"\n\n\"I!\" cried Robert, and, followed by his friend Wilson, he disappeared\nlike a cat in the depths of the foliage.\n\n[Sidenote: GOING BIRD'S-NESTING.]\n\nDuring their absence Paganel found dry moss in sufficient quantity; he\navailed himself of a ray of sunlight, which was easy, for the orb of\nday now shone with a vivid brightness, and then, with the aid of his\nlens, he kindled without difficulty the combustible materials which\nwere laid on a bed of leaves in the fork of the branches. It was a\nnatural fireplace, with no danger of conflagration.\n\nWilson and Robert soon returned with an armful of dead wood, which was\ncast on the fire. Paganel, to cause a draught, placed himself above the\nfireplace, his long legs crossed in the Arab fashion; then, moving his\nbody rapidly up and down, he produced, by means of his poncho, a strong\ncurrent of air. The wood kindled, and a bright, roaring flame soon rose\nfrom this improvised oven. Each dried himself in his own way, while the\nponchos, hung on the branches, swung to and fro in the breeze.", "They now breakfasted, sparingly however, for they had to allow for the\nfollowing day. The immense basin might not perhaps be empty so soon as\nGlenarvan hoped, and, moreover, the provisions were limited. The tree\nbore no fruit; but fortunately it afforded a remarkable supply of fresh\neggs, thanks to the numerous nests that loaded the branches, not to\nspeak of their feathered occupants. These resources were by no means to\nbe despised. The question now was, therefore, in case of a prolonged\nstay, how to secure comfortable quarters.\n\n\"Since the kitchen and dining-room are on the ground floor,\" said\nPaganel, \"we will sleep in the first story. The house is large, the\nrent reasonable, and we must take our ease. I perceive that above there\nare natural cradles, in which, when we have once laid ourselves, we\nshall sleep as well as in the best beds in the world. We have nothing\nto fear; moreover, we will keep watch, and there are enough of us to\nrepulse all the wild animals.\"\n\n\"Only we have no arms,\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"I have my revolvers,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"And I mine,\" replied Robert.\n\n\"What use,\" continued Tom Austin, \"if Mr. Paganel does not find the\nmeans of manufacturing powder?\"\n\n\"It is not necessary,\" replied MacNabb, showing a full flask.\n\n\"Where did you get that, major?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"Of Thalcave. He thought it might be useful to us, and gave it to me\nbefore going back to Thaouka.\"\n\n\"Brave and generous Indian!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" added Tom Austin, \"if all the Patagonians are fashioned after\nthis model, I pay my respects to Patagonia.\"\n\n\"I desire that the horse be not forgotten,\" said Paganel. \"He forms\npart of the Patagonian, and, if I am not greatly mistaken, we shall see\nthem again.\"\n\n\"How far are we from the Atlantic?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Not more than forty miles,\" answered Paganel. \"And now, my friends,\nsince each is free to act, I ask permission to leave you. I am going to\nchoose an observatory above, and, with the aid of my telescope, will\nkeep you acquainted with what goes on here.\"\n\nThe geographer was allowed to go. He very adroitly swung himself\nfrom branch to branch, and disappeared behind the thick curtain of\nfoliage. His companions at once occupied themselves with making the\nsleeping-room and preparing their beds, which was neither a difficult\nnor a lengthy task. As there were no bedclothes to fix nor furniture to\narrange, each soon resumed his place by the fire.\n\nThey then conversed, but not about their present condition, which they\nmust patiently endure. They returned to the inexhaustible subject of\nCaptain Grant's recovery. If the waters subsided, in three days the\ntravelers would be again on board the Duncan. But the captain and his\ntwo sailors, those unfortunate castaways, would not be with them; and\nit even seemed after this failure, after this vain search in South\nAmerica, as if all hope of finding them were irrevocably lost. Whither\ndirect a new search? What, too, would be the grief of Lady Helena and\nMary Grant on learning that the future had no hope in store for them!\n\n\"Poor sister!\" exclaimed Robert; \"all is over for us!\"\n\n[Illustration: Glenarvan, Paganel, the major, Austin, and Mulready were\nseated astraddle, or dangling in the branches, according to their own\ninclinations.]\n\nGlenarvan, for the first time, had no consoling answer to make.\nWhat hope could he give the child? Had he not followed with rigorous\nexactitude the directions of the document?\n\n\"At all events,\" said he, \"this thirty-seventh degree of latitude is\nno vain indication. Have we not supposed, interpreted, and ascertained\nthat it relates to the shipwreck or the captivity of Captain Grant?\nHave we not read it with our own eyes?\"\n\n\"All that is true, my lord,\" replied Tom Austin; \"nevertheless our\nsearch has not succeeded.\"\n\n\"It is discouraging as well as annoying,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Annoying if you will,\" replied MacNabb, in a calm tone, \"but not\ndiscouraging. Precisely because we thus have a definite item, we must\nthoroughly exhaust all its instructions.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"What do you think ought to be\ndone?\"\n\n\"A very simple and reasonable thing, my dear Edward. Let us turn our\nfaces towards the east, when we are on board the Duncan, and follow\nthe thirty-seventh parallel even around to our starting-point, if\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"Do you think, my dear major, that I have not thought of this?\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Indeed I have, a hundred times. But what chance have we of\nsucceeding? Is not leaving the American continent departing from the\nplace indicated by Captain Grant himself, from Patagonia, so clearly\nnamed in the document?\"\n\n\"Do you wish to begin your search in the Pampas again,\" replied the\nmajor, \"when you are sure that the shipwreck of the Britannia did not\ntake place on the Pacific or Atlantic coast?\"\n\nGlenarvan did not answer.\n\n\"And however feeble the chance of finding Captain Grant by following\nthis latitude may be, still ought we not to attempt it?\"\n\n\"I do not deny it,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: APPLIED GEOGRAPHY.]\n\n\"And you, my friends,\" added the major, addressing the sailors, \"are\nyou not of my opinion?\"\n\n\"Entirely,\" answered Tom Austin, while Wilson and Mulready nodded\nassent.\n\n\"Listen to me, my friends,\" continued Glenarvan, after a few moments\nof reflection, \"and you too, Robert, for this is a serious question.\nI shall do everything possible to find Captain Grant, as I have\nundertaken to do, and shall devote my entire life, if necessary,\nto this object. All Scotland would join me to save this noble man\nwho sacrificed himself for her. I too think, however slight may\nbe the chance, that we ought to make the tour of the world on the\nthirty-seventh parallel; and I shall do so. But this is not the point\nto be settled: there is a much more important one, and it is this:\nOught we once and for all to abandon our search on the American\ncontinent?\"\n\nThis question, so directly asked, was unanswered. No one dared to\ndeclare his opinion.\n\n\"Well?\" resumed Glenarvan, addressing the major more especially.\n\n\"My dear Edward,\" replied MacNabb, \"it would involve too great a\nresponsibility to answer you now. The case requires consideration.\nBut first of all I desire to know what countries the thirty-seventh\nparallel crosses.\"\n\n\"That is Paganel's business,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"Let us ask him, then,\" said the major.\n\nThe geographer was no longer to be seen, as he was hidden by the thick\nfoliage. It was necessary to call him.\n\n\"Paganel! Paganel!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Present!\" answered a voice which seemed to come to them from the sky.\n\n\"Where are you?\"\n\n\"In my tower.\"\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Surveying the wide horizon.\"\n\n\"Can you come down a moment?\"\n\n\"Do you need me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To know what countries the thirty-seventh parallel crosses.\"\n\n\"Nothing easier,\" replied Paganel; \"I need not even disturb myself to\ntell you.\"\n\n\"Very well, then.\"\n\n\"Leaving America, the thirty-seventh parallel crosses the Atlantic.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"It strikes Tristan d'Acunha Island.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"It passes two degrees to the south of the Cape of Good Hope.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"It runs across the Indian Ocean.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"It grazes St. Paul's Island of the Amsterdam group.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"It cuts Australia across the province of Victoria.\"\n\n\"Proceed.\"\n\n\"Leaving Australia----\"\n\nThis last sentence was not finished. Did the geographer hesitate?\nDid he know no more? No; but a startling cry was heard in the top of\nthe tree. Glenarvan and his friends grew pale as they gazed at each\nother. Had a new calamity happened? Had the unfortunate Paganel fallen?\nAlready Wilson and Mulready were hastening to his assistance, when a\nlong body appeared. Paganel dangled from branch to branch. His hands\ncould grasp nothing. Was he alive, or dead? They did not know; but\nhe was about to fall into the roaring waters, when the major, with a\nstrong hand, arrested his progress.\n\n\"Very much obliged, MacNabb!\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Why, what is the matter with you?\" said the major.\n\n[Illustration: A long body appeared. Paganel dangled from branch to\nbranch. His hands could grasp nothing. Was he alive, or dead?]\n\n\"What has got into you? Is this another of your eternal distractions?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied Paganel, in a voice choked with emotion (and\nleaves). \"Yes, a distraction,--phenomenal this time.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"We have been mistaken! We are still mistaken!\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"Glenarvan, major, Robert, my friends,\" cried Paganel, \"all you who\nhear me, we are seeking Captain Grant where he is not.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Not only where he is not,\" added Paganel, \"but even where he has never\nbeen.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nPAGANEL'S DISCLOSURE.\n\n\nA profound astonishment greeted these unexpected words. What did the\ngeographer mean? Had he lost his senses? He spoke, however, with\nsuch conviction that all eyes were turned towards Glenarvan. This\ndeclaration of Paganel was a direct answer to the question the former\nhad asked. But Glenarvan confined himself to a negative gesture,\nindicating disbelief in the geographer, who, as soon as he was master\nof his emotion, resumed.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, in a tone of conviction, \"yes, we have gone astray in\nour search, and have read in the document what is not written there.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, Paganel,\" said the major; \"and more calmly.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A NEW IDEA.]\n\n\"That is very simple, major. Like you, I was in error; like you, I\nstruck upon a false interpretation. When, but a moment ago, at the top\nof this tree, in answer to the question, at the word 'Australia' an\nidea flashed through my mind, and all was clear.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Glenarvan, \"do you pretend that Captain Grant----\"\n\n\"I pretend,\" replied Paganel, \"that the word _Austral_ in the document\nis not complete, as we have hitherto supposed, but the root of the word\n_Australia_.\"\n\n\"This is something singular,\" said the major.\n\n\"Singular!\" replied Glenarvan, shrugging his shoulders; \"it is simply\nimpossible!\"", "\"This is something singular,\" said the major.\n\n\"Singular!\" replied Glenarvan, shrugging his shoulders; \"it is simply\nimpossible!\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" continued Paganel, \"is a word that we do not allow in\nFrance.\"\n\n\"What!\" added Glenarvan, in a tone of the greatest incredulity, \"do you\npretend, with that document in your possession, that the shipwreck of\nthe Britannia took place on the shores of Australia?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it!\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"By my faith, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"this is a pretension that\nastonishes me greatly, coming from the secretary of a geographical\nsociety.\"\n\n\"Why?\" inquired Paganel, touched in his sensitive point.\n\n\"Because, if you admit the word Australia, you admit at the same time\nthat there are Indians in that country, a fact which has not yet been\nproved.\"\n\nPaganel was by no means surprised at this argument. He seemingly\nexpected it, and began to smile.\n\n\"My dear Glenarvan,\" said he, \"do not be too hasty in your triumph.\nI am going to defeat you completely, as no Englishman has ever been\ndefeated.\"\n\n\"I ask nothing better. Defeat me, Paganel.\"\n\n\"Listen, then. You say that the Indians mentioned in the document\nbelong exclusively to Patagonia. The incomplete word _indi_ does not\nmean Indians, but natives (_indig\u00e8nes_). Now do you admit that there\nare natives in Australia?\"\n\nIt must be confessed that Glenarvan now gazed fixedly at Paganel.\n\n\"Bravo, Paganel!\" said the major.\n\n\"Do you admit my interpretation, my dear lord?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"if you can prove to me that the imperfect\nword _gonie_ does not relate to the country of the Patagonians.\"\n\n\"No,\" cried Paganel, \"it certainly does not mean Patagonia. Read\nanything you will but that.\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"_Cosmogonie! th\u00e9ogonie! agonie!_\"\n\n\"_Agonie!_\" cried the major.\n\n\"That is indifferent to me,\" replied Paganel; \"the word has no\nimportance. I shall not even search for what it may signify. The\nprincipal point is that _Austral_ means Australia, and we must have\nbeen blindly following a false trail, not to have discovered before so\nevident a meaning. If I had found the document, if my judgment had not\nbeen set aside by your interpretation, I should never have understood\nit otherwise.\"\n\nThis time cheers, congratulations, and compliments greeted Paganel's\nwords. Austin, the sailors, the major, and Robert especially, were\ndelighted to revive their hopes, and applauded the worthy geographer.\nGlenarvan, who had gradually been undeceived, was, as he said, almost\nready to surrender.\n\n\"One last remark, my dear Paganel, and I have only to bow before your\nsagacity.\"\n\n\"Speak!\"\n\n\"How do you arrange these newly-interpreted words, and in what way do\nyou read the document?\"\n\n[Illustration: The hunt promised well, and gave hopes of culinary\nwonders.]\n\n\"Nothing is easier. Here is the document,\" said Paganel, producing the\nprecious paper that he had studied so conscientiously for several\ndays. A profound silence ensued, while the geographer, collecting his\nthoughts, took his time to answer. His finger followed the incomplete\nlines on the document, while, in a confident tone, he expressed himself\nin the following terms:\n\n\n\"'June 7th, 1862, the brig Britannia, of Glasgow, foundered after'--let\nus put, if you wish, 'two days, three days,' or, 'a long struggle,'--it\nmatters little, it is quite unimportant,--'on the coast of Australia.\nDirecting their course to shore, two sailors and Captain Grant\nendeavored to land,' or 'did land on the continent, where they will\nbe,' or 'are prisoners of cruel natives. They cast this document,' and\nso forth. Is it clear?\"\n\n\"It is clear,\" replied Glenarvan, \"if the word _continent_ can be\napplied to Australia, which is only an island.\"\n\n\"Be assured, my dear Glenarvan, the best geographers are agreed in\nnaming this island the Australian continent.\"\n\n\"Then I have but one thing to say, my friends,\" cried Glenarvan. \"To\nAustralia, and may Heaven assist us!\"\n\n\"To Australia!\" repeated his companions, with one accord.\n\n\"Do you know, Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"that your presence on board\nthe Duncan is a providential circumstance?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Paganel, \"let us suppose that I am an envoy of\nProvidence, and say no more about it.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A FESTIVE BANQUET.]\n\nThus ended this conversation, that in the future led to such great\nresults. It completely changed the moral condition of the travelers.\nThey had caught again the thread of the labyrinth in which they had\nthought themselves forever lost. A new hope arose on the ruins of\ntheir fallen projects. They could fearlessly leave behind them this\nAmerican continent, and already all their thoughts flew away to the\nAustralian land. On reaching the Duncan, they would not bring despair\non board, and Lady Helena and Mary Grant would not have to lament the\nirrevocable loss of the captain. Thus they forgot the dangers of their\nsituation in their new-found joy, and their only regret was that they\ncould not start at once.\n\nIt was now four o'clock in the afternoon, and they resolved to take\nsupper at six. Paganel wished to celebrate this joyful day by a\nsplendid banquet. As the bill of fare was very limited, he proposed\nto Robert that they should go hunting \"in the neighboring forest,\"\nat which idea the boy clapped his hands. They took Thalcave's\npowder-flask, cleaned the revolvers, loaded them with fine shot, and\nstarted.\n\n\"Do not go far,\" said the major, gravely, to the two huntsmen.\n\nAfter their departure Glenarvan and MacNabb went to consult the notches\non the tree, while Wilson and Mulready revived the smouldering embers.\n\nArriving at the surface of this immense lake, they saw no sign of\nabatement. The waters seemed to have attained their highest elevation;\nbut the violence with which they rolled from south to north proved that\nthe equilibrium of the Argentine rivers was not yet established. Before\nthe liquid mass could lower, it must first become calm, like the sea\nwhen flood-tide ends and ebb begins. They could not, therefore, expect\na subsidence of the waters so long as they flowed towards the north\nwith such swiftness.\n\nWhile Glenarvan and the major were making these observations, reports\nresounded in the tree, accompanied by cries of joy almost as noisy.\nThe clear treble of Robert contrasted sharply with the deep bass of\nPaganel, and the strife was which should be the most boyish. The hunt\npromised well, and gave hopes of culinary wonders.\n\nWhen the major and Glenarvan returned to the fire, they had to\ncongratulate Wilson upon an excellent idea. The honest sailor had\ndevoted himself to fishing with wonderful success, with the aid of\na pin and a piece of string. Several dozen of little fish, delicate\nas smelts, called \"mojarras,\" wriggled in a fold of his poncho, and\nseemed likely to make an exquisite dish.\n\nAt this moment the hunters descended from the top of the tree. Paganel\ncarefully carried some black swallows' eggs and a string of sparrows,\nwhich he meant afterwards to serve up as larks. Robert had adroitly\nbrought down several pairs of \"hilgueros,\"--little green-and-yellow\nbirds, which are excellent eating, and very much in demand in the\nMontevideo market. The geographer, who knew many ways of preparing\neggs, had to confine himself this time to cooking them in the hot\nashes. However, the repast was as varied as it was delicate. The dried\nmeat, the hard eggs, the broiled mojarras, and the roast sparrows and\nhilgueros, formed a repast which was long remembered.\n\nThe conversation was very animated. Paganel was greatly complimented in\nhis twofold capacity of hunter and cook, and accepted these encomiums\nwith the modesty that belongs to true merit. Then he gave himself up to\nsingular observations on the magnificent tree that sheltered them with\nits foliage, and whose extent, as he declared, was immense.\n\n\"Robert and I,\" said he jokingly, \"imagined ourselves in the open\nforest during the hunt. One moment I thought we should be lost. I could\nnot find my way. The sun was declining towards the horizon. I sought\nin vain to retrace my steps. Hunger made itself felt acutely. Already\nthe gloomy coppices were resounding with the growls of ferocious\nbeasts,--but no, there are no ferocious beasts, and I am sorry.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Glenarvan, \"you are sorry there are no ferocious beasts?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"But, when you have everything to fear from their ferocity----\"\n\n\"Ferocity does not exist,--scientifically speaking,\" replied the\ngeographer.\n\n[Illustration: However, the repast was as varied as it was delicate.\nThe dried meat, the hard eggs, the broiled mojarras, and the roast\nsparrows and hilgueros, formed a repast which was long remembered.]\n\n\"Ha! this time, Paganel,\" said the major, \"you will not make me admit\nthe utility of ferocious beasts. What are they good for?\"\n\n\"Major,\" cried Paganel, \"they are good to form classifications, orders,\nfamilies, genera, sub-genera, species----\"\n\n\"Very fine!\" said MacNabb. \"I should not have thought of that! If I\nhad been one of Noah's companions at the time of the deluge, I should\ncertainly have prevented that imprudent patriarch from putting into\nthe ark pairs of tigers, lions, bears, panthers, and other animals as\ndestructive as they were useless.\"\n\n\"Should you have done so?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"I should.\"\n\n\"Well, you would have been wrong in a zoological point of view.\"\n\n\"But not in a human one.\"\n\n\"This is shocking,\" continued Paganel; \"for my part, I should have\npreserved all the animals before the deluge of which we are so\nunfortunately deprived.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" replied MacNabb, \"that Noah was right in abandoning them\nto their fate, admitting that they lived in his time.\"\n\n\"I tell you that Noah was wrong,\" retorted Paganel, \"and deserves the\nmalediction of scholars to the end of time.\"", "\"I tell you that Noah was wrong,\" retorted Paganel, \"and deserves the\nmalediction of scholars to the end of time.\"\n\nThe listeners to this argument could not help laughing at seeing the\ntwo friends dispute about what Noah ought to have done or left undone.\nThe major, who had never argued with any one in his life, contrary to\nall his principles, was every day at war with Paganel, who must have\nparticularly excited him.\n\nGlenarvan, according to his custom, interrupted the debate, and said,--\n\n[Sidenote: WANTED, A JAGUAR!]\n\n\"However much it is to be regretted, in a scientific or human point of\nview, that we are deprived of ferocious animals, we must be resigned\nto-day to their absence. Paganel could not hope to encounter any in\nthis aerial forest.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the geographer, \"although we beat the bush. It is a pity,\nfor it would have been a glorious hunt. A ferocious man-eater like the\njaguar! With one blow of his paw he can twist the neck of a horse. When\nhe has tasted human flesh, however, he returns to it ravenously. What\nhe likes best is the Indian, then the negro, then the mulatto, and then\nthe white man.\"\n\n\"However that may be, my good Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"so long as\nthere are no Indians, mulattoes, or negroes among us, I rejoice in\nthe absence of your dear jaguars. Our situation is not, of course, so\nagreeable----\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you complain of your lot?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Are you at your ease in these\nuncomfortable and uncushioned branches?\"\n\n\"I have never been more so, even in my own study. We lead the life of\nbirds; we sing and flutter about. I almost think that men were destined\nto live in the trees.\"\n\n\"They only want wings,\" said the major.\n\n\"They will make them some day.\"\n\n\"In the meantime,\" replied Glenarvan, \"permit me, my dear friend, to\nprefer the sand of a park, the floor of a house, or the deck of a\nvessel to this aerial abode.\"\n\n\"Glenarvan,\" said Paganel, \"we must take things as they come. If\nfavorable, so much the better; if unfavorable, we must not mind it. I\nsee you long for the comforts of Malcolm Castle.\"\n\n\"No, but----\"\n\n\"I am certain that Robert is perfectly happy,\" interrupted Paganel, to\nsecure one advocate, at least, of his theories.\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur Paganel!\" cried the boy, in a joyful tone.\n\n\"It is natural at his age,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"And at mine,\" added the geographer. \"The less ease we have, the fewer\nwants; the fewer wants, the happier we are.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the major, \"here is Paganel going to make an attack upon\nriches and gilded splendor.\"\n\n\"No, my dear major,\" continued Paganel; \"but, if you wish, I will tell\nyou, in this connection, a little Arab story that occurs to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Monsieur Paganel,\" cried Robert.\n\n\"And what will your story prove?\" asked the major.\n\n\"What all stories prove, my brave companion.\"\n\n\"Not much, then,\" replied MacNabb. \"But go on, Scheherezade, and tell\none of those stories that you relate so well.\"\n\n\"There was once upon a time,\" said Paganel, \"a son of the great\nHaroun-al-Raschid who was not happy. He accordingly consulted an old\ndervish, who told him that happiness was a very difficult thing to\nfind in this world. 'However,' added he, 'I know an infallible way\nto procure you happiness.' 'What is it?' inquired the young prince.\n'It is,' replied the dervish, 'to put on the shirt of a happy man.'\nThereupon the prince embraced the old man, and set out in search of his\ntalisman. He visited all the capitals of the earth; he tried the shirts\nof kings, emperors, princes, and nobles; but it was a useless task, he\nwas no happier. Then he put on the shirts of artists, warriors, and\nmerchants, but with no more success. He had thus traveled far, without\nfinding happiness. At last, desperate from having tried so many shirts,\nhe was returning very sadly one beautiful day to the palace of his\nfather, when he spied in the field an honest laborer, who was joyously\nsinging as he ploughed. 'Here is, at all events, a man who possesses\nhappiness,' said he to himself, 'or happiness does not exist on earth.'\nHe approached him. 'Good man,' said he, 'are you happy?' 'Yes,' replied\nthe other. 'You wish for nothing?' 'No.' 'You would not change your lot\nfor that of a king?' 'Never!' 'Well, sell me your shirt!' 'My shirt! I\nhave none!'\"\n\n[Illustration: They were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to\nhave courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one\nhas neither palace nor cottage.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nBETWEEN FIRE AND WATER.\n\n\nJacques Paganel's story had a very great success. He was greatly\napplauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer\nobtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody.\nHowever, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have\ncourage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has\nneither palace nor cottage.\n\nDuring the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could\nbe distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's\nbenefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant.\n\n[Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.]\n\nWhile the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon\nassumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined,\ngradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of\nthreatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky.\nIts motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not\na breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves. Glenarvan, Paganel, and Robert were sensibly affected by\nthese electric currents.\n\n\"We shall have a storm,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"You are not afraid of thunder?\" asked Glenarvan of the boy.\n\n\"Oh, no, my lord,\" replied Robert.\n\n\"Well, so much the better; for the storm is now not far distant.\"\n\n\"And it will be violent,\" continued Paganel, \"so far as I can judge\nfrom the state of the sky.\"\n\n\"It is not the storm that troubles me,\" said Glenarvan, \"but the\ntorrents of rain with which it will be accompanied. We shall be\ndrenched to the skin again. Whatever you may say, Paganel, a nest\ncannot suffice a man, as you will soon learn to your cost.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it can, with philosophy,\" briskly replied the geographer.\n\n\"Philosophy does not prevent you from getting wet.\"\n\n\"No, but it warms you.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Glenarvan, \"let us join our friends and persuade\nthem to envelop us with their philosophy and their ponchos as closely\nas possible, and especially to lay in a stock of patience, for we shall\nneed it.\"\n\nSo saying, he gave another look at the threatening sky. The mass of\nclouds now covered it entirely. A faint line of light towards the\nhorizon was scarcely discernible in the dimness. The sombre appearance\nof the water had increased, and between the dark mass below and the\nclouds above there was scarcely a separation. At the same time all\nperception seemed dulled; and a leaden torpor rested upon both eyes and\nears, while the silence was profound.\n\n\"Let us go down,\" said Glenarvan; \"the lightning will soon be here.\"\n\nHis two companions and himself slid down the smooth branches, and were\nsomewhat surprised to find themselves in a remarkable kind of twilight,\nwhich was produced by myriads of luminous objects that crossed each\nother and buzzed on the surface of the water.\n\n\"Phosphorescences?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Paganel, \"but phosphorescent insects, real\nglow-worms,--living diamonds, and not expensive, of which the ladies of\nBuenos Ayres make magnificent ornaments for themselves.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Robert, \"are these things, that fly like sparks, insects?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy.\"\n\nRobert caught one of the brilliant creatures. Paganel was right. It\nwas a kind of large beetle, an inch in length, to which the Indians\ngive the name of \"tuco-tuco.\" This curious insect threw out flashes at\ntwo points situated in front of its sheath, and its light would have\nenabled one to read in the darkness. Paganel, on bringing it close to\nhis watch, saw that it was ten o'clock.\n\nGlenarvan now joined the major and the three sailors, and gave them\ninstructions for the night. A terrible storm was to be expected. After\nthe first rollings of the thunder, the wind would doubtless break forth\nand the tree be violently shaken. It was, therefore, advisable for\nevery one to tie himself firmly to the bed of branches that had been\nappropriated to him. If they could not avoid the torrents of the sky,\nthey must at least guard against those of the earth, and not fall\ninto the rapid current that broke against the trunk of the tree. They\nwished each other good night without much hope of passing one, and then\neach, getting into his aerial resting-place, wrapped himself in his\nponcho and waited for sleep.", "[Illustration: The incessant flashes assumed various forms. Some,\ndarting perpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six\ntimes in the same place; others spread in zigzag lines, and produced on\nthe dark vault of the heavens astonishing jets of arborescent flame.]\n\nBut the approach of a mighty tempest brings to the hearts of most\nsentient beings a vague anxiety of which the bravest cannot divest\nthemselves. The occupants of the tree, agitated and fearful, could not\nclose their eyes, and the first thunder-clap found them all awake.\nIt took place about eleven o'clock, resembling a distant rumbling.\nGlenarvan climbed to the end of the branch, and peered out from the\nfoliage. The dark firmament was fitfully illumined by vivid and\nbrilliant flashes, which the waters brightly reflected, and which\ndisclosed great rifts in the clouds. Glenarvan, after surveying the\nzenith and the horizon, returned to his couch.\n\n\"What do you think, Glenarvan?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"I think that the storm is beginning, and, if it continues, it will be\nterrible.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" replied the enthusiastic Paganel. \"I like a fine\nspectacle, especially when I cannot avoid it. Only one thing would make\nme anxious, if anxiety served to avert danger,\" added he, \"and that\nis, that the culminating point of this plain is the ombu upon which we\nare perched. A lightning-conductor would be very useful here, for this\nvery tree among all those of the Pampas is the one that particularly\nattracts the lightning. And then, as you are aware, my friends,\nmeteorologists advise us not to take refuge under trees during a storm.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the major, \"that is timely advice.\"\n\n\"It must be confessed, Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan, \"that you choose a\ngood time to tell us these encouraging things!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" replied Paganel; \"all times are good to receive information. Ah,\nit is beginning!\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN EXTRAORDINARY STORM.]\n\nViolent thunder-claps interrupted this conversation, and their\nintensity increased till they reached the most deafening peals.\nThey soon became sonorous, and made the atmosphere vibrate in rapid\noscillations. The firmament was on fire, and during this commotion\nit was impossible to distinguish from what electric spark emanated\nthe indefinitely-prolonged rumblings that reverberated throughout the\nabysses of the sky.\n\nThe incessant flashes assumed various forms. Some, darting\nperpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six times in\nthe same place; others, separating into a thousand different branches,\nspread in zigzag lines and produced on the dark vault of the heavens\nastonishing jets of arborescent flame. Soon the sky, from east to\nnorth, was crossed by a phosphorescent band of intense brilliancy. This\nillumination gradually overspread the entire horizon, lighting up the\nclouds like a bonfire, and was reflected in the mirror-like waters,\nforming what seemed to be an immense circle of fire, of which the tree\noccupied the centre.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions watched this terrific spectacle in\nsilence. Sheets of dazzling light glided towards them, and blinding\nflashes followed in rapid succession, now showing the calm countenance\nof the major, then the speculative face of Paganel or the energetic\nfeatures of Glenarvan, and again the frightened look of Robert or the\nunconcerned expression of the sailors. The rain, however, did not fall\nas yet, nor had the wind risen. But soon the flood-gates of the heavens\nopened, and the rain came down in torrents, the drops, as they struck\nthe surface of the water, rebounding in thousands of sparks illuminated\nby the incessant lightning.\n\nDid this rain predict the end of the storm? Were Glenarvan and his\ncompanions to be released with a few thorough drenchings? At the height\nof this struggle of the elements, suddenly there appeared at the end\nof the branch which extended horizontally, a flaming globe, of the\nsize of a fist, and surrounded by a black smoke. This ball, after\nrevolving a few moments, burst like a bombshell, and with a noise that\nwas distinguishable in the midst of the general tumult. A sulphurous\nvapor filled the atmosphere. There was a moment of silence, and then\nTom Austin was heard crying,--\n\n\"The tree is on fire!\"\n\nHe was right. In a moment the flame, as if it had been communicated\nto an immense piece of fireworks, spread along the west side of the\ntree. The dead limbs, the nests of dry grass, and finally the live wood\nitself, furnished material for the devouring element.\n\nThe wind now rose and fanned the flames into fury. Glenarvan and his\nfriends, speechless with terror, and venturing upon limbs that bent\nbeneath their weight, hastily took refuge in the other, the eastern\npart of the tree.\n\nMeantime the boughs shriveled, crackled, and twisted in the fire like\nburning serpents. The glowing fragments fell into the rushing waters\nand floated away in the current, sending forth flashes of ruddy light.\nThe flames at one moment would rise to a fearful height, to be lost\nin the aerial conflagration, and the next, beaten back by the furious\nhurricane, would envelop the tree like a robe of molten gold.\n\nGlenarvan, Robert, the major, Paganel, and the sailors, were terrified.\nA thick smoke was stifling them; an intolerable heat was scorching\nthem. The fire was extending to the lower part of the tree on their\nside; nothing could stop or extinguish it; and they felt themselves\nirrevocably doomed to the torture of those victims who are confined\nwithin the burning sides of a sacrificial fire-basket.\n\nAt last their situation was no longer tenable, and of two deaths they\nwere forced to choose the least cruel.\n\n\"To the water!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n[Illustration: In a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the\nombu, and enveloped it in its watery folds.]\n\nWilson, whom the flames had reached, had already plunged into the\ncurrent, when they heard him cry, in tones of the greatest terror,--\n\n\"Help! help!\"\n\nAustin rushed towards him and assisted him to regain the trunk.\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"Caymans! caymans!\" replied Wilson. And, in truth, the foot of the\ntree was seen to be surrounded by the most formidable monsters.\nTheir scales glittered in broad plates of light, sharply defined\nby the conflagration. Their flat tails, their pointed heads, their\nprotruding eyes, their jaws, extending back of their ears, all these\ncharacteristic signs were unmistakable. Paganel recognized the\nvoracious alligators peculiar to America, and called caymans in Spanish\ncountries. There were a dozen of them, beating the water with their\npowerful tails, and attacking the tree with their terrible teeth.\n\nAt this sight the unfortunate travelers felt themselves lost indeed. A\nhorrible death was in store for them,--to perish either by the flames\nor by the teeth of the alligators. There are circumstances in which\nman is powerless to struggle, and where a raging element can only be\nrepulsed by another equally strong. Glenarvan, with a wild look, gazed\nat the fire and water leagued against him, not knowing what aid to\nimplore of Heaven.\n\nThe storm had now begun to abate; but it had developed in the air a\ngreat quantity of vapor, which the electric phenomena were about to\nset in violent commotion. To the south an enormous water-spout was\ngradually forming,--an inverted cone of mist, uniting the raging waters\nbelow to the stormy clouds above. It advanced revolving with frightful\nrapidity, collected at its centre a liquid column, and by a powerful\nattraction, caused by its gyratory motion, drew towards it all the\nsurrounding currents of air.\n\n[Sidenote: A STRANGE BARK.]\n\nIn a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the ombu and enveloped\nit in its watery folds. The tree was shaken to its very base, so that\nGlenarvan might have thought that the alligators had attacked it\nwith their powerful jaws and were uprooting it from the ground. His\ncompanions and he, clinging to one another, felt the mighty tree give\nway and fall, and saw its flaming branches plunge into the tumultuous\nwaters with a frightful hiss. It was the work of a second. The\nwater-spout had passed, to exert elsewhere its destructive violence,\nand pumping the waters of the plain as if it would exhaust them.\n\nThe tree now, loosened from its moorings, floated onward under the\ncombined impulses of wind and current. The alligators had fled, except\none which crawled along the upturned roots and advanced with open jaws;\nbut Mulready, seizing a large brand, struck the creature so powerful\na blow that he broke its back. The vanquished animal sank in the\neddies of the torrent, still lashing his formidable tail with terrible\nviolence.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, delivered from these voracious creatures,\ntook refuge on the branches to leeward of the fire, while the tree,\nwrapped by the blast of the hurricane in glowing sheets of flame,\nfloated on like a burning ship in the darkness of the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nTHE RETURN ON BOARD.\n\n\nFor two hours the tree floated on the immense lake without reaching\n_terra firma_. The flames had gradually died out, and thus the\nprincipal danger of this terrible voyage had vanished. The current,\nstill keeping its original direction, flowed from southwest to\nnortheast; the darkness, though illumined now and then by flashes, had\nbecome profound, and Paganel sought in vain for his bearings. But the\nstorm was abating, the large drops of rain gave place to light spray\nthat was scattered by the wind, while the huge distended clouds were\ncrossed by light bands.", "The tree advanced rapidly on the impetuous torrent, gliding with\nsurprising swiftness, as if some powerful propelling means were\ninclosed within its trunk. There was as yet no certainty that they\nwould not float on thus for many days. About three o'clock in the\nmorning, however, the major observed that the roots now and then struck\nthe bottom. Tom Austin, by means of a long branch, carefully sounded,\nand declared that the water was growing shallow. Twenty minutes later,\na shock was felt, and the progress of the tree was checked.\n\n\"Land! land!\" cried Paganel, in ringing tones.\n\nThe ends of the charred branches had struck against a hillock on the\nground, and never were navigators more delighted to land. Already\nRobert and Wilson, having reached a firm plateau, were uttering shouts\nof joy, when a well-known whistle was heard. The sound of a horse's\nhoofs was heard upon the plain, and the tall form of the Indian emerged\nfrom the darkness.\n\n[Illustration: The sound of a horse's hoofs was heard upon the plain,\nand the tall form of the Indian emerged from the darkness.]\n\n\n\"Thalcave!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Thalcave!\" repeated his companions, as with one voice.\n\n\"Friends!\" said the Patagonian, who had waited for them there, knowing\nthat the current would carry them as it had carried him.\n\nAt the same moment he raised Robert in his arms and clasped him to his\nbreast. Glenarvan, the major, and the sailors, delighted to see their\nfaithful guide again, shook his hands with the most earnest cordiality.\nThe Patagonian then conducted them to an abandoned estancia. Here\na good fire was burning, which revived them, and on the coals were\nroasting succulent slices of venison, to which they did ample justice.\nAnd when their refreshed minds began to reflect, they could scarcely\nbelieve that they had escaped so many perils,--the fire, the water, and\nthe formidable alligators.\n\nThalcave, in a few words, told his story to Paganel, and ascribed to\nhis intrepid horse all the honor of having saved him. Paganel then\nendeavored to explain to him the new interpretation of the document,\nand the hopes it led them to entertain. Did the Indian understand the\ngeographer's ingenious suppositions? It was very doubtful; but he saw\nhis friends happy and very confident, and he desired nothing more.\n\nIt may be easily believed that these courageous travelers, after their\nday of rest on the tree, needed no urging to resume their journey. At\neight o'clock in the morning they were ready to start. They were too\nfar south to procure means of transport, and were therefore obliged\nto travel on foot. The distance, however, was only forty miles, and\nThaouka would not refuse to carry from time to time a tired pedestrian.\nIn thirty-six hours they would reach the shores of the Atlantic.\n\n[Sidenote: IN THE DARK.]\n\nAs soon as refreshed the guide and his companions left behind them\nthe immense basin, still covered with the waters, and proceeded across\nelevated plains, on which, here and there, were seen groves planted by\nEuropeans, meadows, and occasionally native trees. Thus the day passed.\n\nThe next morning, fifteen miles before reaching the ocean, its\nproximity was perceptible. They hastened on in order to reach Lake\nSalado, on the shores of the Atlantic, the same day. They were\nbeginning to feel fatigued, when they perceived sand-hills that hid the\nfoaming waves, and soon the prolonged murmur of the rising tide struck\nupon their ears.\n\n\"The ocean!\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, the ocean!\" replied Thalcave.\n\nAnd these wanderers, whose strength had seemed almost about to fail,\nclimbed the mounds with wonderful agility. But the darkness was\nprofound, and their eyes wandered in vain over the gloomy expanse. They\nlooked for the Duncan, but could not discern her.\n\n\"She is there, at all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"waiting for us.\"\n\n\"We shall see her to-morrow,\" replied MacNabb.\n\nTom Austin shouted seaward, but received no answer. The wind was very\nstrong, and the sea tempestuous. The clouds were driving from the west,\nand the foaming crests of the waves broke over the beach in masses of\nspray. If the Duncan was at the appointed rendezvous, the lookout man\ncould neither hear nor be heard. The coast afforded no shelter. There\nwas no bay, no harbor, no cove; not even a creek. The beach consisted\nof long sand-banks that were lost in the sea, and the vicinity of\nwhich is more dangerous than that of the rocks in the face of wind and\ntide. These banks, in fact, increase the waves; the sea is peculiarly\nboisterous around them, and ships are sure to be lost if they strike on\nthese bars in heavy storms.\n\nIt was therefore very natural that the Duncan, considering this coast\ndangerous, and knowing it to be without a port of shelter, kept at a\ndistance. Captain Mangles must have kept to the windward as far as\npossible. This was Tom Austin's opinion, and he declared that the\nDuncan was not less than five miles at sea.\n\nThe major, accordingly, persuaded his impatient relative to be\nresigned, as there was no way of dissipating the thick darkness. And\nwhy weary their eyes in scanning the gloomy horizon? He established a\nkind of encampment in the shelter of the sand-hills; the remains of\nthe provisions furnished them a final repast; and then each, following\nthe major's example, hollowed out a comfortable bed in the sand, and,\ncovering himself up to his chin, was soon wrapped in profound repose.\n\nGlenarvan watched alone. The wind continued strong, and the ocean still\nshowed the effects of the recent storm. The tumultuous waves broke\nat the foot of the sand-banks with the noise of thunder. Glenarvan\ncould not convince himself that the Duncan was so near him; but as for\nsupposing that she had not arrived at her appointed rendezvous, it\nwas impossible, for such a ship there were no delays. The storm had\ncertainly been violent and its fury terrible on the vast expanse of the\nocean, but the yacht was a good vessel and her captain an able seaman;\nshe must, therefore, be at her destination.\n\nThese reflections, however, did not pacify Glenarvan. When heart and\nreason are at variance, the latter is the weaker power. The lord of\nMalcolm Castle seemed to see in the darkness all those whom he loved,\nhis dear Helena, Mary Grant, and the crew of the Duncan. He wandered\nalong the barren coast which the waves covered with phosphorescent\nbubbles. He looked, he listened, and even thought that he saw a fitful\nlight on the sea.\n\n\"I am not mistaken,\" he soliloquized; \"I saw a ship's light, the\nDuncan's. Ah! why cannot my eyes pierce the darkness?\"\n\n[Illustration: Glenarvan watched alone. He could not convince himself\nthat the Duncan was so near him; but as for supposing that she had not\narrived at her appointed rendezvous, it was impossible, for such a ship\nthere were no delays.]\n\nThen an idea occurred to him. Paganel called himself a nyctalops; he\ncould see in the night.\n\nThe geographer was sleeping like a mole in his bed, when a strong hand\ndragged him from his sandy couch.\n\n\"Who is that?\" cried he.\n\n\"I.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Glenarvan. Come, I need your eyes.\"\n\n\"My eyes?\" replied Paganel, rubbing them vigorously.\n\n\"Yes, your eyes, to distinguish the Duncan in this darkness. Come.\"\n\n\"And why my eyes?\" said Paganel to himself, delighted, nevertheless, to\nbe of service to Glenarvan.\n\nHe rose, shaking his torpid limbs in the manner of one awakened from\nsleep, and followed his friend along the shore. Glenarvan requested\nhim to survey the dark horizon to seaward. For several moments Paganel\nconscientiously devoted himself to this task.\n\n\"Well, do you perceive nothing?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Nothing. Not even a cat could see two paces before her.\"\n\n\"Look for a red or a green light, on the starboard or the larboard\nside.\"\n\n\"I see neither a red nor a green light. All is darkness,\" replied\nPaganel, whose eyes were thereupon involuntarily closed.\n\nFor half an hour he mechanically followed his impatient friend in\nabsolute silence, with his head bowed upon his breast, sometimes\nraising it suddenly. He tottered along with uncertain steps, like those\nof a drunken man. At last Glenarvan, seeing that the geographer was in\na state of somnambulism, took him by the arm, and, without waking him,\nled him back to his sand-hole, and comfortably deposited him therein.\n\nAt break of day they were all started to their feet by the cry,--\n\n[Sidenote: IMPATIENCE.]\n\n\"The Duncan! the Duncan!\"\n\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" replied Glenarvan's companions, rushing to the shore.\n\nThe Duncan was indeed in sight. Five miles distant, the yacht was\nsailing under low pressure, her main-sails carefully reefed, while her\nsmoke mingled with the mists of the morning. The sea was high, and a\nvessel of her tonnage could not approach the shore without danger.\n\nGlenarvan, provided with Paganel's telescope, watched the movements of\nthe Duncan. Captain Mangles could not have perceived them, for he did\nnot approach, but continued to coast along with only a reefed top-sail.\n\nAt this moment Thalcave, having loaded his carbine heavily, fired it in\nthe direction of the yacht. They gazed and listened. Three times the\nIndian's gun resounded, waking the echoes of the shore.\n\nAt last a white smoke issued from the side of the yacht.\n\n\"They see us!\" cried Glenarvan. \"It is the Duncan's cannon.\"\n\nA few moments after, a heavy report rang out on the air, and the\nDuncan, shifting her sail and putting on steam, was seen to be\napproaching the shore. By the aid of the glass they saw a boat leave\nthe ship's side.\n\n\"Lady Helena cannot come,\" said Tom Austin: \"the sea is too rough.\"\n\n\"Nor Captain Mangles,\" replied MacNabb: \"he cannot leave his vessel.\"\n\n\"My sister! my sister!\" cried Robert, stretching his arms towards the\nyacht, which rolled heavily.\n\n\"I hope I shall soon get on board!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Patience, Edward! You will be there in two hours,\" replied MacNabb.\n\nGlenarvan now joined Thalcave, who, standing with folded arms alongside\nof Thaouka, was calmly gazing at the waves.", "\"Patience, Edward! You will be there in two hours,\" replied MacNabb.\n\nGlenarvan now joined Thalcave, who, standing with folded arms alongside\nof Thaouka, was calmly gazing at the waves.\n\nGlenarvan took his hand, and, pointing to the yacht, said,--\n\n\"Come!\"\n\nThe Indian shook his head.\n\n\"Come, my friend!\" continued Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Thalcave, gently. \"Here is Thaouka, and there are the\nPampas!\" he added, indicating with a sweep of his hand the vast expanse\nof the plains.\n\nIt was clear that the Indian would never leave the prairies, where the\nbones of his fathers whitened. Glenarvan knew the strong attachment\nof these children of the desert to their native country. He therefore\nshook Thalcave's hand, and did not insist; not even when the Indian,\nsmiling in his peculiar way, refused the price of his services,\nsaying,--\n\n\"It was done out of friendship.\"\n\nHis lordship, however, desired to give the brave Indian something which\nmight at least serve as a souvenir of his European friends. But what\nhad he left? His arms, his horses, everything had been lost in the\ninundation. His friends were no richer than himself. For some moments\nhe was at a loss how to repay the disinterested generosity of the brave\nguide; but at last a happy idea occurred to him. He drew from his\npocket-book a costly medallion inclosing an admirable portrait, one of\nLawrence's master-pieces, and presented it to Thalcave.\n\n\"My wife,\" said Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave gazed with wonder at the portrait, and pronounced these simple\nwords,--\n\n\"Good and beautiful!\"\n\nThen Robert, Paganel, the major, Tom Austin, and the two sailors\nbade an affectionate adieu to the noble Patagonian, who clasped each\none in succession to his broad breast. All were sincerely sorry at\nparting with so courageous and devoted a friend. Paganel forced him\nto accept a map of South America and the two oceans, which the\nIndian had frequently examined with interest. It was the geographer's\nmost precious possession. As for Robert, he had nothing to give but\ncaresses, which he freely lavished upon his deliverer and upon Thaouka.\n\n[Illustration: They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the\nshore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the\nIndian was seen through the foam of the waves.]\n\nAt that instant the Duncan's boat approached, and, gliding into the\nnarrow channel between the sand-banks, grounded on the beach.\n\n\"My wife?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"My sister?\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Lady Helena and Miss Grant await you on board,\" replied the cockswain.\n\"But we have not a moment to lose, my lord, for the tide is beginning\nto ebb.\"\n\nThe last acknowledgments were given, and Thalcave accompanied his\nfriends to the boat. Just as Robert was about to embark, the Indian\ntook him in his arms and gazed at him tenderly.\n\n\"Now go,\" said he; \"you are a man!\"\n\n\"Adieu, my friend, adieu!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Shall we ever see each other again?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"Who knows?\" replied Thalcave, raising his arms towards heaven.\n\nThey pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the\nebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was\nseen through the foam of the waves. Then his tall form grew indistinct,\nand soon became invisible. An hour afterwards they reached the Duncan.\nRobert was the first to spring upon the deck, where he threw himself\nupon his sister's neck, while the crew of the yacht filled the air with\ntheir joyous shouts.\n\nThus had our travelers accomplished the journey across South America\non a rigorously straight line. Neither mountains nor rivers had turned\nthem aside from their course; and, although they were not forced to\nstruggle against the evil designs of men, the relentless fury of the\nelements had often tested their generous intrepidity to its utmost\npowers of endurance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nA NEW DESTINATION.\n\n\nThe first moments were consecrated to the happiness of meeting.\nLord Glenarvan did not wish the joy in the hearts of his friends to\nbe chilled by tidings of their want of success. His first words,\ntherefore, were,--\n\n\"Courage, my friends, courage! Captain Grant is not with us, but we are\nsure to find him.\"\n\nIt needed only such an assurance to restore hope to the passengers of\nthe Duncan. Lady Helena and Mary Grant, while the boat was approaching\nthe ship, had experienced all the anguish of suspense. From the deck\nthey endeavored to count those who were returning. At one time the\nyoung girl would despair; at another she would think she saw her\nfather. Her heart beat quickly; she could not speak; she could scarcely\nstand. Lady Helena supported her, while Captain Mangles stood beside\nher in silence. His keen eyes, accustomed to distinguish distant\nobjects, could not discern the captain.\n\n\"He is there! he is coming! my father!\" murmured the young girl.\n\nBut as the boat gradually drew near, the illusion vanished. Not only\nLady Helena and the captain, but Mary Grant, had now lost all hope. It\nwas, therefore, time for Glenarvan to utter his assuring words.\n\n[Sidenote: \"BREAKFAST!\"]\n\nAfter the first embraces, all were informed of the principal incidents\nof the journey; and, first of all, Glenarvan made known the new\ninterpretation of the document, due to the sagacity of Jacques Paganel.\nHe also praised Robert, of whom his sister had a right to be proud.\nHis courage, his devotion, and the dangers that he had overcome, were\nconspicuously set forth by his noble friend, so that the boy would not\nhave known where to hide himself, if his sister's arms had not afforded\nhim a sure refuge.\n\n[Illustration: Lady Helena and Mary Grant, while the boat was\napproaching the ship, had experienced all the anguish of suspense. From\nthe deck they endeavored to count those who were returning.]\n\n\"You need not blush, Robert,\" said Captain Mangles; \"you have behaved\nlike the worthy son of Captain Grant.\"\n\nHe stretched out his arms towards Mary's brother, and pressed his lips\nto the boy's cheeks, which were still wet with tears.\n\nThey then spoke of the generous Thalcave. Lady Helena regretted that\nshe could not have shaken hands with the brave Indian. MacNabb, after\nthe first outbursts of enthusiasm, repaired to his cabin to shave\nhimself. As for Paganel, he flitted hither and thither, like a bee,\nextracting the honey of compliments and smiles. He wished to embrace\nall on board the Duncan, and, beginning with Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, ended with Mr. Olbinett, the steward, who could not better\nrecognize such politeness than by announcing breakfast.\n\n\"Breakfast!\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Olbinett.\n\n\"A real breakfast, on a real table, with table-cloth and napkins?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And shall we not eat hard eggs, or ostrich steaks?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Paganel!\" replied the worthy steward, greatly embarrassed.\n\n\"I did not mean to offend you, my friend,\" said the geographer; \"but\nfor a month our food has been of that sort, and we have dined, not at\na table, but stretched on the ground, except when we were astride of\nthe trees. This breakfast that you have just announced seemed to me,\ntherefore, like a dream, a fiction, a chimera.\"\n\n\"Well, we will test its reality, Monsieur Paganel,\" replied Lady\nHelena, who could not help laughing.\n\n\"Accept my arm,\" said the gallant geographer.\n\n\"Has your lordship any orders to give?\" inquired Captain Mangles.\n\n\"After breakfast, my dear fellow,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we will discuss\nin council the programme of the new expedition.\"\n\nThe passengers and the young captain then descended to the cabin.\nOrders were given to the engineer to keep up steam, that they might\nstart at the first signal. The major and the travelers, after a rapid\ntoilette, seated themselves at the table. Ample justice was done to\nMr. Olbinett's repast, which was declared excellent and even superior\nto the splendid banquets of the Pampas. Paganel called twice for every\ndish, \"through absent-mindedness,\" as he said. This unfortunate word\nled Lady Helena to inquire if the amiable Frenchman had occasionally\nshown his habitual failing. The major and Lord Glenarvan looked at each\nother with a smile. As for Paganel, he laughed heartily, and promised\n\"upon his honor\" not to commit a single blunder during the entire\nvoyage. He then in a very comical way told the story of his mistake in\nthe study of Spanish.\n\n\"After all,\" he added, in conclusion, \"misfortunes are sometimes\nbeneficial, and I do not regret my error.\"\n\n\"And why, my worthy friend?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Because I not only know Spanish, but Portuguese also. I speak two\nlanguages instead of one.\"\n\n\"By my faith, I should not have thought of that,\" replied MacNabb. \"My\ncompliments, Paganel, my sincere compliments!\"\n\n[Sidenote: TABLE-TALK IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC.]\n\nPaganel was applauded, but did not lose a single mouthful. He did not,\nhowever, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the\nyoung captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant. A slight sign\nfrom Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at\nthe two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed\nthe captain, but upon a different subject.\n\n\"How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Excellently,\" replied the captain; \"only I must inform your lordship\nthat we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!\"\n\n\"Hang yourself!\" said the major.\n\n\"Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my\nrope!\" retorted the geographer.\n\n\"Well, my dear Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"unless we are endowed with\nubiquity, we cannot be everywhere. Since you crossed the Pampas, you\ncould not at the same time double Cape Horn.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I am sorry,\" replied the geographer.\n\nCaptain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated\nby Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,--", "\"Nevertheless, I am sorry,\" replied the geographer.\n\nCaptain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated\nby Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,--\n\n\"My dear young lady, I see that Captain John pays his homage to your\nnoble qualities, and I am happy to find that you are not displeased\nwith his ship.\"\n\n\"Oh, how could I be?\" replied Mary, gazing at Lady Helena, and perhaps\nalso at the young captain.\n\n\"My sister loves you, Mr. Captain,\" cried Robert, \"and I do too.\"\n\n\"And I return your love, my dear boy,\" replied Captain Mangles, a\nlittle confused by Robert's words, which also brought a slight blush to\nthe face of the young girl.\n\nThen, changing the conversation to a less embarrassing subject, the\ncaptain added,--\n\n\"Since I have related the Duncan's voyage, will not your lordship give\nus a few particulars of your travels, and the exploits of our young\nhero?\"\n\nNo recital could have been more agreeable to Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant, and Glenarvan hastened to satisfy their curiosity. He told, word\nfor word, all about their journey from ocean to ocean. The passage\nof the Andes, the earthquake, Robert's disappearance, his capture by\nthe condor, Thalcave's fortunate shot, the adventure with the wolves,\nthe boy's devotion, the meeting with Sergeant Manuel, the inundation,\ntheir refuge in the tree, the lightning, the fire, the alligators,\nthe water-spout, the night on the shores of the Atlantic, all these\nincidents, cheerful or serious, excited alternately the joy and terror\nof his hearers. Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert\nthe caresses of his sister and Lady Helena. Never was boy more highly\npraised, or by more enthusiastic friends.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" remarked Lord Glenarvan, when he had finished his\nrecital, \"let us think of the present. Let us return to the subject of\nCaptain Grant.\"\n\nWhen breakfast was over, the party repaired to Lady Helena's\nstate-room, and, taking seats around a table loaded with maps and\ncharts, resumed the conversation. Glenarvan explained that the\nshipwreck had not taken place on the shores either of the Pacific or\nthe Atlantic, and that, consequently, the document had been wrongly\ninterpreted so far as Patagonia was concerned; that Paganel, by a\nsudden inspiration, had discovered the mistake and proved that they had\nbeen following a false trail. The geographer was accordingly asked to\nexplain the French document, which he did to the satisfaction of every\none. When he had finished his demonstration, Glenarvan announced that\nthe Duncan would immediately set sail for Australia.\n\nThe major, however, before the order was given, asked permission to\nmake a single remark.\n\n\"Speak, major,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"My object,\" said MacNabb, \"is not to invalidate the arguments of my\nfriend Paganel, still less to refute them. I consider them rational,\nsagacious, and worthy of our whole attention. But I desire to submit\nthem to a final examination, that their validity may be incontestable.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"My object,\" said MacNabb, \"is not to invalidate the\narguments of my friend Paganel, still less to refute them.\"]\n\nNo one knew what the prudent MacNabb meant, and his hearers listened\nwith some anxiety.\n\n\"Go on, major,\" said Paganel: \"I am ready to answer all your questions.\"\n\n\"Nothing can be simpler,\" said the major. \"Five months ago, in\nthe Frith of Clyde, when we studied the three documents, their\ninterpretation seemed clear to us. No place but the western coast of\nPatagonia could, we thought, have been the scene of the shipwreck. We\nhad not even the shadow of a doubt on the subject.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" added Glenarvan.\n\n\"Afterwards,\" resumed the major, \"when Paganel, in a moment of\nprovidential absent-mindedness, embarked on board our vessel, the\ndocuments were submitted to him, and he unhesitatingly sanctioned our\nsearch upon the American coast.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" observed the geographer.\n\n\"And, nevertheless, we are mistaken,\" said the major.\n\n\"Yes, we are mistaken,\" repeated Paganel; \"but to be mistaken is only\nto be human, while it is the part of a madman to persist in his error.\"\n\n\"Wait, Paganel,\" continued the major; \"do not get excited. I do not\nmean that our search ought to be prolonged in America.\"\n\n\"What do you ask, then?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"Simply the acknowledgment that Australia now seems to be the scene of\nthe Britannia's shipwreck as much as South America did before.\"\n\n\"Granted,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Who knows, then,\" resumed the major, \"whether, after Australia,\nanother country may not offer us the same probabilities, and whether,\nwhen this new search proves vain, it may not seem evident that we ought\nto have searched elsewhere?\"\n\n[Sidenote: FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.]\n\nGlenarvan and Paganel glanced at each other. The major's remarks were\nstrictly correct.\n\n\"I desire, therefore,\" added MacNabb, \"that a final test be made before\nwe start for Australia. Here are the documents and maps. Let us examine\nsuccessively all points that the thirty-seventh parallel crosses, and\nsee if there is not some other country to which the document has as\nprecise a reference.\"\n\n\"Nothing is easier,\" replied Paganel.\n\nThe map was placed before Lady Helena, and all showed themselves ready\nto follow Paganel's demonstration. After carefully examining the\ndocuments, it was unanimously agreed that Paganel's interpretation was\nthe correct one.\n\n\"I leave you, therefore, my friends,\" said he, in conclusion, \"to\ndecide whether all the probabilities are not in favor of the Australian\ncontinent.\"\n\n\"Evidently,\" replied the passengers and the captain with unanimity.\n\n\"Captain,\" said Glenarvan, \"have you sufficient provisions and coal?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord, I procured ample supplies at Talcahuana, and, besides,\nwe can lay in a fresh stock of fuel at Cape Town.\"\n\n\"One more remark,\" said the major.\n\n\"A thousand, if you please!\"\n\n\"Whatever may be the guarantees for success in Australia, will it not\nbe well to call for a day or two, in passing, at the islets of Tristan\nd'Acunha and Amsterdam? They are situated so near our strict line of\nsearch, that it is worth our while to ascertain if there be on them any\ntrace of the shipwreck of the Britannia.\"\n\n\"The unbeliever!\" said Paganel.\n\n\"I do not want to have to return to them, monsieur, if Australia does\nnot after all realize our newly-conceived expectations.\"\n\n\"The precaution is not a bad one,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n[Illustration: At sunrise they saw the conical peak of Tristan,\nseemingly separated from all the rest of the rocky group.]\n\n[Illustration: A few hours of their united toil resulted in the death\nof a large number of seals who were \"caught napping.\"]\n\n\"And I do not wish to dissuade you; quite the contrary,\" replied the\ngeographer.\n\n\"Well, then, we will adopt it, and start forthwith,\" said Lord\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"Immediately, my lord,\" replied the captain, as he went on deck, while\nRobert and Mary Grant uttered the liveliest expressions of gratitude;\nand the Duncan, leaving the American coast and heading to the east, was\nsoon swiftly ploughing the waves of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nTRISTAN D'ACUNHA AND THE ISLE OF AMSTERDAM.\n\n\n[Sidenote: LOOKING ALOFT.]\n\nThe Duncan now had before her a broad stretch of ocean but little\ntraversed by navigators. Between the shores of South America and the\nlittle speck in the ocean known by the name of Tristan d'Acunha, there\nwas no probability of her meeting with any strange sail; and under some\ncircumstances, or in some company, the days might have been monotonous\nand the hours might have hung wearily. But so ardent was the desire\nfor success, and so accomplished, yet varied, were the characters of\nthose who composed the little assembly, that the voyage on the South\nAtlantic, though devoid of striking incident, was by no means wanting\nin interest. Much of the time was spent on deck, where the ladies'\ncabins were now located, Mary Grant especially training her hand, head,\nand heart in feeling, thought, and action. The geographer set to work\non a composition entitled \"Travels of a Geographer on the Argentine\nPampas;\" but many a blank page did he leave. Tho Scottish peer (when\ntired of examining for the thousandth time all that belonged to his\nyacht) could look at the books and documents which he had brought with\nhim, intending to peruse them carefully. And as to the major he was\nnever in company and never out of company; his cigar insured, nothing\nelse was wanted.\n\nEver and anon many miles of the ocean would be covered by masses of\nsea-weed; these different species of alg\u00e6 would afford subject for\nresearch; specimens must be preserved, authorities must be consulted,\nand as one result at least all would become wiser. Then a discussion\nwould ensue on some geographical problem, and maps that were not\nattainable were of course appealed to by each disputant, though the\nsubject in question was often of very trivial moment. It was in the\nmidst of a debate of this kind, during the evening, that a sailor cried\nout,--\n\n\"Land ahead!\"\n\n\"In what direction?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"To windward,\" replied the sailor.\n\nThe landsmen's eyes were strained, but to no purpose. The geographer's\ntelescope was brought into requisition, but with no avail. \"I do not\nsee the land,\" said its owner.\n\n\"Look into the clouds,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Ah!\" replied Paganel, struck with the idea, and shortly with the\nreality also; for there was the barren mountain-top of Tristan d'Acunha.\n\n\"Then,\" said he, \"if I remember aright, we are eighty miles from it. Is\nnot that the distance from which this mountain is visible?\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" replied the captain.\n\nA few hours brought them much nearer to the group of high and steep\nrocks, and at sunrise they saw the conical peak of Tristan, seemingly\nseparated from all the rest of the rocky group, and reflecting the\nglory of the blue heavens and of the rising orb on the placid sea at\nits base.\n\nThere are three islets in this group,--Tristan d'Acunha, Inaccessible,\nand Rossignol; but it was only at the first", "There are three islets in this group,--Tristan d'Acunha, Inaccessible,\nand Rossignol; but it was only at the first\n\n[Illustration: Our friends found a few voluntary exiles on the former\nisland, who, by means of seal-fishing, eke out a scanty existence in\nthis out-of-the-way spot.]\n\n[Illustration: Inasmuch as this was sufficient to cook fish,\nPaganel decided that it was not necessary for him to bathe here\n\"geographically.\"] of these that the Duncan called. Inquiry was made\nof the authorities (for these islets are governed by a British official\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope) if there were any tidings of the Britannia.\nBut nothing was known of such a ship; they were told of the shipwrecks\nwhich had occurred, but there was nothing that afforded a clue to that\nwhich they sought. They spent some hours in examination of the fauna\nand flora, which were not very extensive. They saw and were seen by the\nsparse population that subsist here, and in the afternoon of the same\nday the yacht left the islands and islanders so rarely visited.\n\nWhilst the passengers had been thus engaged, Lord Glenarvan had allowed\nhis crew to employ their time advantageously to themselves in capturing\nsome of the seals which are so plentiful in these latitudes. A few\nhours of their united toil resulted in the death of a large number\nof seals who were \"caught napping,\" and in the stowing away, for the\nprofit of the crew when they should reach the Australian market,\nseveral barrels of the oil obtained from their carcases.\n\nStill onward on the same parallel lay the course of the Duncan,\ntowards the Isles of Amsterdam and St. Paul; and the same subjects\nof conversation, study, and speculation engaged them all, until, one\nmorning, they espied the first mentioned island, far ahead; and as they\ndrew nearer, a peak rose clearly before their vision which strongly\nreminded them of the Peak of Teneriffe they had beheld a few months\nbefore.\n\n[Sidenote: WARM SPRINGS AND WARM TALK.]\n\nThe Isle of Amsterdam or St. Peter, and the Isle of St. Paul, have been\nvisited by very few, and but little is known of them. The latter is\nuninhabited; but our friends found a few voluntary exiles on the former\nisland, who, by means of seal-fishing, eke out a scanty existence in\nthis out-of-the-way spot. Here again inquiry was made, but in vain,\nfor any information of the Britannia, her voyage, or her shipwreck.\nNeither on the Isle of Amsterdam nor on that of St. Paul, which the\nwhalers and seal-fishers sometimes visit, had there been any trace of\nthe catastrophe.\n\nDesolate as these lonely islands appeared to our travelers, they still\nwere not devoid of objects of interest. They were meagre enough in\nvegetation and in animal life; but there were warm springs which well\nrepaid a visit. Captain Mangles found the temperature of their waters\nto be 166\u00b0 Fahrenheit; and, inasmuch as this was sufficient to cook\nfish, Paganel decided that it was not necessary for him to bathe here\n\"geographically.\"\n\nWhen they resumed their course, though many miles were before them,\nthere was a growing sense of anticipation; they were not to pause again\nuntil the \"Australian continent\" was reached; and more and more did\nthe conversation and discussions tend towards this continent as their\nsubject. On one occasion so certain was Paganel as to the ease with\nwhich they would be able to pursue their search, when they arrived,\nthat he asserted that more than fifty geographers had already made the\ncourse clear for them.\n\n\"What! fifty, do you say?\" asked the major, with an air of doubt.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb, decidedly,\" said the geographer, piqued at the hesitancy\nto believe him.\n\n\"Impossible!\" replied the major.\n\n\"Not at all; and if you doubt my veracity, I will cite their names.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the major, quietly, \"you clever people stick at nothing.\"\n\n\"Major,\" said Paganel, \"will you wager your rifle against my telescope\nthat I cannot name at least fifty Australian explorers?\"\n\n\"Of course, Paganel, if you like,\" replied MacNabb, seeing that he\ncould not now recede from his position without incurring the ridicule\nof the company.\n\n[Illustration: \"Major,\" said Paganel, \"will you wager your rifle\nagainst my telescope that I cannot name at least fifty Australian\nexplorers?\"]\n\n[Illustration: \"Master Robert shall count for us.\" And forthwith the\nlearned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of\nthe discovery of Australia.]\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Paganel to Lady Helena and Miss Grant, \"come and\nbe umpires, and Master Robert shall count for us.\" And forthwith the\nlearned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of\nthe discovery of Australia, with the names of its discoverers and the\ndates of their explorations, as fluently as though his sole calling in\nlife was to be professor of Australian history. Rapidly he mentioned\nthe first twenty who found or traversed the Austral shores; as rapidly\ndid the names of the second score flow from his lips; and after the\nprescribed fifty had been enumerated, he kept on as though his list\nwere inexhaustible.\n\n\"Enough, enough, Monsieur Paganel!\" said Lady Helena. \"You have shown\nthat there is nothing, great or small, about Australia, of which you\nare ignorant.\"\n\n\"Nay, madam,\" said the geographer, with a bow.\n\nThen, with a peculiar expression, he smiled as he said to the major,\n\"We will talk about the rifle at another time.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nTHE STORM ON THE INDIAN OCEAN.\n\n\nTwo days after this conversation, Captain Mangles took an observation,\nand the passengers saw, to their great satisfaction, upon consulting\nthe map, that they were in the vicinity of Cape Bernouilli, which\nthey might expect to reach in four days. The west wind had hitherto\nfavored the progress of the yacht, but for several days it had shown a\ntendency to fail, and now there was a perfect calm. The sails flapped\nidly against the masts, and had it not been for her powerful screw, the\nDuncan would have been becalmed on the ocean.\n\n[Sidenote: FOREBODINGS OF DISASTER.]\n\nThis state of things might be prolonged indefinitely. At evening\nGlenarvan consulted the captain on the subject. The latter, whose\nsupply of coal was rapidly diminishing, appeared much disturbed at the\nsubsidence of the wind. He had covered his ship with canvas, and set\nhis studding- and main-sails, that he might take advantage of the least\nbreeze; but, in nautical language, there was not enough wind \"to fill a\nhat.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"we need not complain. It is better to\nbe without wind than to have a contrary one.\"\n\n\"Your lordship is right,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"but I dread some\nsudden change in the weather. We are now in the neighborhood of the\ntrade-winds, which, from October to April, blow from the northeast, and\nour progress will, therefore, be very much retarded.\"\n\n\"But what can we do, captain? If this misfortune occurs, we must submit\nto it. It will only be a delay, after all.\"\n\n\"Probably, if a storm does not come upon us too.\"\n\n\"Do you fear bad weather?\" asked Glenarvan, looking at the sky, which,\nhowever, was cloudless.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the captain. \"I tell your lordship, but would conceal my\napprehensions from Lady Helena and Miss Grant.\"\n\n\"You act wisely. What do you apprehend?\"\n\n\"There are signs of a great storm. Do not trust the appearance of the\nsky, my lord; nothing is more deceptive. For two days the barometer\nhas fallen to an alarming degree. This is a warning that I cannot\ndisregard. I particularly fear the storms of the South Seas, for I have\nbeen already exposed to them.\"\n\n\"John,\" replied Glenarvan, \"the Duncan is a stout vessel, and her\ncaptain a skillful seaman. Let the storm come; we will take care of\nourselves.\"\n\nCaptain Mangles, while giving expression to his fears, was by no means\nforgetful of his duty as a sailor. The steady fall of the barometer\ncaused him to take every measure of precaution. The sky, as yet, gave\nno indication of the approaching tempest; but the warnings of his\ninfallible instrument were not to be disregarded.\n\nThe young captain accordingly remained on deck all night. About eleven\no'clock the sky grew threatening towards the south. All hands were\nimmediately called on deck, to take in the sails. At midnight the wind\nfreshened. The creaking of the masts, the rattling of the rigging,\nand the groaning of bulkheads informed the passengers of the state of\naffairs. Paganel, Glenarvan, the major, and Robert came on deck to\nrender assistance if it should be needed. Over the sky, that they had\nleft clear and studded with stars, now rolled thick clouds broken by\nlight bands and spotted like the skin of a leopard.\n\n\"Has the storm broken upon us?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Not yet, but it will presently,\" replied the captain.\n\nAt that moment he gave the order to reef the top-sail. The sailors\nsprang into the windward rattlings, and with difficulty accomplished\ntheir task. Captain Mangles wished to keep on as much sail as possible,\nto support the yacht and moderate her rolling. After these precautions\nhad been taken, he told the mate and the boatswain to prepare for the\nassault of the tempest, which could not be long in breaking forth.\nStill, like an officer at the storming of a breach, he did not leave\nthe point of observation, but from the upper deck endeavored to draw\nfrom the stormy sky its secrets.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ADDED CALAMITY.]\n\nIt was now one o'clock in the morning. Lady Helena and Miss Grant,\naroused by the unusual bustle, ventured to come on deck. The wind was\nsharply whistling through the cordage, which, like the strings of a\nmusical instrument, resounded as if some mighty bow had caused their\nrapid vibrations; the pulleys clashed against each other; the ropes\ncreaked with a sharp sound in their rough sockets; the sails cracked\nlike cannon, and vast waves rolled up to assail the yacht, as it\nlightly danced on their foaming crests.", "When the captain perceived the ladies, he approached and besought them\nto return to the cabin. Several waves had already been shipped, and the\ndeck might be swept at any moment. The din of the elements was now so\npiercing that Lady Helena could scarcely hear the young captain.\n\n\"Is there any danger?\" she managed to ask him during a momentary lull\nin the storm.\n\n\"No, madam,\" replied he; \"but neither you nor Miss Mary can remain on\ndeck.\"\n\nThe ladies did not oppose an order that seemed more like an entreaty,\nand returned to the cabin just as a wave, rolling over the stern,\nshook the compass-lights in their sockets. The violence of the wind\nredoubled; the masts bent under the pressure of sail, and the yacht\nseemed to rise on the billows.\n\n\"Brail up the main-sail!\" cried the captain; \"haul in the top-sails and\njibs!\"\n\nThe sailors sprang to their places; the halyards were loosened, the\nbrails drawn down, the jibs taken in with a noise that rose above the\nstorm, and the Duncan, whose smoke-stack belched forth torrents of\nblack smoke, rolled heavily in the sea.\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Paganel, and Robert gazed with admiration and\nterror at this struggle with the waves. They clung tightly to the\nrigging, unable to exchange a word, and watched the flocks of stormy\npetrels, those melancholy birds of the storm, as they sported in the\nraging winds.\n\nAt that moment a piercing sound was heard above the roar of\nthe hurricane. The steam was rapidly escaping, not through the\nescape-valve, but through the pipes of the boiler. The alarm-whistle\nsounded with unusual shrillness; the yacht gave a terrible lurch, and\nWilson, who was at the helm, was overthrown by an unexpected blow\nof the wheel. The vessel was in the trough of the sea, and no longer\nmanageable.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" cried Captain Mangles, rushing to the stern.\n\n\"The ship is careening!\" replied Austin.\n\n\"Is the rudder unhinged?\"\n\n\"To the engine! to the engine!\" cried the engineer.\n\nThe captain rushed down the ladder. A cloud of steam filled the\nengine-room; the pistons were motionless in their cylinders, and the\ncranks gave no movement to the shaft. The engineer, seeing that all\nefforts were useless, and fearing for his boilers, had let out the\nsteam through the escape-valve.\n\n\"What has happened?\" asked the captain.\n\n\"The screw is either bent or entangled,\" replied the engineer; \"it will\nnot work.\"\n\n\"Is it impossible to free it?\"\n\n\"Impossible, at present.\"\n\nTo attempt to repair the accident at that moment was out of the\nquestion. The screw would not move, and the steam, being no longer\neffective, had escaped through the valves. The captain was, therefore,\nforced to rely on his sails, and seek the aid of the wind, which had\nbeen hitherto his most dangerous enemy.\n\nHe came on deck, and, briefly informing Glenarvan of the situation,\nbegged him to return to the cabin with the others; but the latter\nwished to remain.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied Captain Mangles, in a firm tone: \"I must be\nalone here with my crew. Go! The ship may be in danger, and the waves\nwould drench you unmercifully.\"\n\n\"But we may be of use----\"\n\n\"Go, go, my lord; you must! There are times when I am master on board.\nRetire, as I wish!\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE STRUGGLE CONTINUED.]\n\nFor John Mangles to express himself so authoritatively, the situation\nmust have been critical. Glenarvan understood that it was his duty to\nobey. He therefore left the deck, followed by his three companions, and\njoined the ladies in the cabin, who were anxiously awaiting the result\nof this struggle with the elements.\n\n\"My brave John is an energetic man,\" remarked Glenarvan as he entered.\n\nMeantime Captain Mangles lost no time in extricating the ship from\nher perilous situation. He resolved to keep towards the Cape, that he\nmight deviate as little as possible from his prescribed course. It was,\ntherefore, necessary to brace the sails obliquely to the wind. The\ntop-sail was reefed, a kind of fore-sail rigged on the main-stay, and\nthe helm crowded hard aport. The yacht, which was a stanch and fleet\nvessel, started like a spirited horse that feels the spur, and proudly\nbreasted the angry billows.\n\nThe rest of the night was passed in this situation. They hoped that the\ntempest would abate by break of day. Vain hope! At eight o'clock in the\nmorning it was still blowing hard, and the wind soon became a hurricane.\n\nThe captain said nothing, but he trembled for his vessel and those\nwhom she carried. The Duncan now and then gave a fearful lurch; her\nstanchions cracked, and sometimes the yards of the mainmast struck the\ncrests of the waves. At one moment the crew thought the yacht would\nnot rise again. Already the sailors, hatchet in hand, were rushing\nto cut away the fore-shrouds, when they were violently torn from\ntheir fastenings by the blast. The ship righted herself, but, without\nsupport on the waves, she was tossed about so terribly that the masts\nthreatened to break at their very foundations. She could not long\nendure such rolling; she was growing weak, and soon her shattered sides\nand opening seams must give way for the water.\n\n[Illustration: Then, impelled by the hurricane, the billows outran\nher; they leaped over the taffrail, and the whole deck was swept with\ntremendous violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: NEARING THE END.]\n\nCaptain Mangles had but one resource,--to rig a storm-jib. He succeeded\nafter several hours' labor, but it was not until three o'clock in the\nafternoon that the jib was hauled to the main-stay and set to the\nwind. With this piece of canvas the Duncan flew before the wind\nwith inconceivable rapidity. It was necessary to keep up the greatest\npossible speed, for upon this alone depended her safety. Sometimes,\noutstripping the waves, she cut them with her slender prow and plunged\nbeneath them, like an enormous sea-monster, while the water swept\nher deck from stem to stern. At other times her swiftness barely\nequaled that of the surges, her rudder lost all power, and she gave\nterrific lurches that threatened to capsize her. Then, impelled by the\nhurricane, the billows outran her; they leaped over the taffrail, and\nthe whole deck was swept with tremendous violence.\n\nThe situation was indeed alarming. The captain would not leave his\npost for an instant. He was tortured by fears that his impassive face\nwould not betray, and persistently sought to penetrate with his gaze\nthe gathering gloom. And he had good cause for fear. The Duncan, driven\nout of her course, was running towards the Australian coast with a\nswiftness that nothing could arrest. He felt, too, as if by instinct,\nthat a strong current was drawing him along. At every moment he feared\nthe shock of a reef upon which the yacht would be dashed into a\nthousand pieces, and he calculated that the shore was not more than a\ndozen miles to leeward.\n\nFinally he went in search of Lord Glenarvan, consulted with him in\nprivate, explained their actual situation, viewed it with the coolness\nof a sailor who is ready for any emergency, and ended by saying that he\nshould be obliged perhaps to run the Duncan ashore.\n\n\"To save those she carries, if possible, my lord,\" he added.\n\n\"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"And Lady Helena and Miss Grant?\"\n\n\"I will inform them only at the last moment, when all hope is gone of\nkeeping at sea. You will tell me.\"\n\n\"I will, my lord.\"\n\nGlenarvan returned to the ladies, who, without knowing all the danger,\nfelt it to be imminent. They displayed, however, a noble courage, equal\nat least to that of their companions. Paganel gave himself up to the\nmost unreasonable theories concerning the direction of atmospheric\ncurrents, while the major awaited the end with the indifference of a\nMussulman.\n\nAbout eleven o'clock the hurricane seemed to moderate a little, the\nheavy mists were gradually dissipated, and through the openings the\ncaptain could see a low land at least six miles to leeward. He steered\ndirectly for it. Huge waves rolled to a prodigious height, and he knew\nthat they must have a firm point of support to reach such an elevation.\n\n\"There are sand-bars here,\" said he to Tom Austin.\n\n\"That is my opinion,\" replied the mate.\n\n\"We are in the hands of God,\" continued the captain. \"If He does not\nhimself guide the Duncan over the bar, we are lost.\"\n\n\"It is high tide now, captain; perhaps we may do it.\"\n\n\"But see the fury of those waves! What ship could resist them? God help\nus, my friend!\"\n\nMeantime the Duncan dashed towards the shore with terrible swiftness.\nSoon she was only two miles from the sand-bars. The mists still\ncontinued to conceal the land. Nevertheless Captain Mangles thought he\nperceived, beyond this foaming barrier, a tranquil haven, where the\nDuncan would be in comparative safety. But how to reach it?\n\nHe called the passengers on deck, for he did not wish, when the hour\nof shipwreck had come, that they should be confined in the cabin.\nGlenarvan and his companions gazed at the awful sea. Mary Grant grew\npale.\n\n\"John,\" said Glenarvan in a low tone to the young captain, \"I will try\nto save my wife, or will perish with her. Do you take charge of Miss\nGrant.\"\n\n[Sidenote: OILY INFLUENCES.]\n\n\"Yes, your lordship,\" was the prompt reply.\n\nThe Duncan was now only a few cable-lengths from the sand-bars. As it\nwas high tide, there would doubtless have been sufficient water to\nenable the yacht to cross these dangerous shoals; but the enormous\nwaves upon which she rose and fell would infallibly have wrecked her.\nWas there then any means of allaying these billows, of calming this\ntumultuous sea?\n\nA sudden idea occurred to the captain.\n\n\"The oil!\" cried he; \"pour on oil, men, pour on oil!\"", "A sudden idea occurred to the captain.\n\n\"The oil!\" cried he; \"pour on oil, men, pour on oil!\"\n\nThese words were quickly understood by all the crew. They were about\nto employ a method that sometimes succeeds. The fury of the sea can\noften be appeased by covering it with a sheet of oil, which floats\non the surface and destroys the shock of the waters. The effect is\ninstantaneous, but transient. As soon as a ship has crossed this\ntreacherous sea, it redoubles its fury; and woe to those who would\nventure to follow.\n\nThe barrels containing the supply of seal-oil were hoisted into the\nforecastle by the crew, to whom the danger gave new strength. Here\nthey were stove in with a blow of the hatchet, and suspended over the\nstarboard rattlings.\n\n\"Hold on!\" cried the captain, waiting for the favorable moment.\n\nIn a few seconds the yacht reached the entrance to the pass, which was\nbarred by a terrible line of foam.\n\n\"Let go!\" cried the young captain.\n\nThe barrels were inverted, and from their sides streamed floods of oil.\nImmediately the unctuous liquid leveled the foaming surface of the sea,\nand the Duncan sailed on calm waters, and was soon in a quiet harbor\nbeyond the terrible sand-bars; and then the ocean, released from its\nfetters, bounded after its escaped prey with indescribable fury.\n\n[Illustration: \"Let go!\" cried the young captain. The barrels were\ninverted, and from their sides streamed floods of oil.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nA HOSPITABLE COLONIST.\n\n\nThe captain's first care was to secure anchorage. He moored the vessel\nin five fathoms of water. The bottom was good, a hard gravel, affording\nan excellent hold. There was no danger of drifting, or of stranding at\nlow tide. The Duncan, after so many hours of peril, was now in a sort\nof creek sheltered by a high promontory from the fury of the wind.\n\nLord Glenarvan shook the hand of the young captain, saying,--\n\n\"Thanks, John!\"\n\nAnd Captain Mangles felt himself fully rewarded by these simple words.\nGlenarvan kept to himself the secret of his anguish, and neither Lady\nHelena, Mary Grant, nor Robert suspected the magnitude of the perils\nthey had just escaped.\n\nOne important point remained to be settled. On what part of the\ncoast had the Duncan been cast by the storm? How could she regain\nher prescribed course? How far were they from Cape Bernouilli? Such\nwere the first questions addressed to the captain, who at once took\nhis bearings and noted his observations on the map. The Duncan had\nnot deviated very far from her route. She was at Cape Catastrophe, on\nthe southern coast of Australia, not three hundred miles from Cape\nBernouilli.\n\nBut could the Duncan's injuries be repaired? This was the question to\ndecide. The captain wished to know the extent of the damage. It was\ndiscovered, by diving, that a flange of the screw was bent and came\nin contact with the stern-post. Hence it was impossible for the screw\nto rotate. This injury was considered serious enough to necessitate\ngoing into dry-dock, which of course could not be done in their present\nlocality.\n\nGlenarvan and the captain, after mature reflection, resolved that\nthe Duncan should follow the western shore, seeking traces of the\nBritannia, should stop at Cape Bernouilli, where further information\ncould be obtained, and then continue southward to Melbourne, where her\ninjuries could be repaired; and, as soon as this was done, that she\nshould cruise along the eastern shores to finish the search.\n\nThis arrangement was approved, and Captain Mangles resolved to take\nadvantage of the first favorable wind. He did not have to wait long.\nTowards evening the hurricane had entirely subsided, and a moderate\nbreeze was blowing from the southwest. Preparations were made for\ngetting under way; new sails were set, and at four o'clock in the\nmorning the sailors heaved at the capstan, the anchor was weighed, and\nthe Duncan, with all sails set, cruised close to windward along the\ncoast.\n\nThey arrived at Cape Bernouilli without finding the least trace of the\nlost vessel. But this failure proved nothing. Indeed, during the two\nyears since the shipwreck, the sea might have scattered or destroyed\nthe fragments of the brig. Besides, the natives, who scent shipwrecks\nas a vulture does a corpse, might have carried away every vestige of\nit. Harry Grant and his two companions, therefore, without doubt, had\nbeen taken prisoners the moment the waves cast them ashore, and been\ncarried into the interior of the country.\n\n[Sidenote: HOPING AGAINST HOPE.]\n\nBut here one of Paganel's ingenious suppositions failed. So long as\nthey were in the Argentine territory, the geographer could rightly\nmaintain that the latitude of the document referred to the place of\ncaptivity,--not to the scene of the shipwreck. Indeed, the great rivers\nof the Pampas and their numerous affluents could easily bear the\ndocument to the sea. In this part of Australia, on the contrary, few\nstreams cross the thirty-seventh parallel, and the principal Australian\nrivers--the Murray, the Yara, the Torrens, and the Darling--either flow\ninto each other, or empty into the ocean by mouths where navigation\nis active. What probability was there, then, that a fragile bottle\ncould have descended these continually navigated waters, and reached\nthe Indian Ocean? This consideration could not escape such sagacious\nminds. Paganel's supposition, plausible in Patagonia, was illogical\nin Australia. The geographer perceived this in a discussion on the\nsubject with the major. It was clear that the latitude applied only to\nthe place of shipwreck, and that consequently the bottle had been cast\ninto the sea where the Britannia was wrecked,--on the western coast of\nAustralia.\n\nHowever, as Glenarvan justly observed, this interpretation did not\npreclude the possibility of Captain Grant's captivity, who, moreover,\nhad intimated as much by the words \"where they will be prisoners of the\ncruel Indians.\" But there was no more reason for seeking the prisoners\non the thirty-seventh parallel than on any other.\n\nThis conclusion, after much discussion, was finally accepted, and it\nwas decided that, if no traces of the Britannia were found at Cape\nBernouilli, Lord Glenarvan should return to Europe, relinquishing all\nhope of finding the object of their search.\n\nThis resolution occasioned profound grief to the children of the lost\ncaptain. As the boats containing the whole of the party were rowed\nashore, they felt that the fate of their father would soon be probably\ndecided; irrevocably, we may say, for Paganel, in a former discussion,\nhad clearly demonstrated that the shipwrecked seamen would have reached\ntheir country long ago, if their vessel had stranded on the other, the\neastern coast.\n\n[Sidenote: A NEW PROSPECT.]\n\n\"Hope! hope! never cease to hope!\" said Lady Helena to the young girl\nseated beside her, as they approached the shore. \"The hand of God will\nnever fail us.\"\n\n[Illustration: As the boats containing the whole of the party were\nrowed ashore, they felt that the fate of their father would soon be\nprobably decided.]\n\n\"Yes, Miss Mary,\" said the captain; \"when men have exhausted human\nresources, then Heaven interposes, and, by some unforeseen event, opens\nto them new ways.\"\n\n\"God grant it, captain!\" replied Mary.\n\nThe shore was now only a cable's length distant. The cape terminated in\ngentle declivities extending far out into the sea. The boat entered a\nsmall creek, between banks of coral in process of formation, which in\ntime would form a chain of reefs along the southern coast of the island.\n\nThe passengers of the Duncan disembarked on a perfectly barren shore.\nSteep cliffs formed a lofty sea-wall, and it would have been difficult\nto scale this natural rampart without ladders or cramping-irons.\nFortunately, the captain discovered a breach half a mile southward,\ncaused by a partial crumbling of the cliffs. Probably the sea, during\nviolent equinoctial storms, had beaten against this fragile barrier,\nand thus caused the fall of the upper portions of the mass.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions entered this opening, and reached the\nsummit of the cliffs by a very steep ascent. Robert climbed an abrupt\ndeclivity with the agility of a cat, and arrived first at the top,\nto the great chagrin of Paganel, who was quite mortified at seeing\nhimself outstripped by a mere lad of twelve. However, he distanced the\npeaceable major; but that worthy was utterly indifferent to his defeat.\n\nThe little party surveyed the plain that stretched out beneath them.\nIt was a vast, uncultivated tract, covered with bushes and brushwood,\nand was compared by Glenarvan to the glens of the Scottish lowlands,\nand by Paganel to the barren lands of Brittany. But though the country\nalong the coast was evidently uninhabited, the presence of man, not the\nsavage, but the civilized worker, was betokened by several substantial\nstructures in the distance.\n\n\"A mill!\" cried Robert.\n\nTrue enough, at no great distance apparently, the sails of a mill were\nseen.\n\n\"It is indeed a mill,\" replied Paganel. \"Here is a beacon as modest as\nit is useful, the sight of which delights my eyes.\"\n\n\"It is almost a belfry,\" said Lady Helena.\n\n\"Yes, madam; and while one makes bread for the body, the other\nannounces bread for the soul. In this respect they resemble each other.\"\n\n\"Let us go to the mill,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\nThey accordingly started. After half an hour's walk the soil assumed\na new aspect. The transition from barren plains to cultivated fields\nwas sudden. Instead of brushwood, quick-set hedges surrounded an\ninclosure freshly ploughed. Some cattle, and half a dozen horses,\ngrazed in pastures encircled by acacias. Then fields of corn were\nreached, several acres of land bristling with the yellow ears, haycocks\nlike great bee-hives, vineyards with blooming inclosures, a beautiful\ngarden, where the useful and the ornamental mingled; in short, a fair\nand comfortable locality, which the merry mill crowned with its pointed\ngable and caressed with the moving shadow of its sails.", "At this moment a man of about fifty, of prepossessing countenance,\nissued from the principal house, at the barking of three great dogs\nthat announced the coming of the strangers. Five stout and handsome\nboys, his sons, accompanied by their mother, a tall, robust woman,\nfollowed him. This man, surrounded by his healthful family, in the\nmidst of these new erections, in this almost virgin country, presented\nthe perfect type of the colonist, who, endeavoring to better his lot,\nseeks his fortune and happiness beyond the seas.\n\nGlenarvan and his friends had not yet introduced themselves, they had\nnot had time to declare either their names or their rank, when these\ncordial words saluted them:--\n\n[Sidenote: AN AUSTRALIAN HOME.]\n\n\"Strangers, welcome to the house of Patrick O'Moore.\"\n\n\"You are an Irishman?\" said Glenarvan, taking the hand that the\ncolonist offered him.\n\n\"I was,\" replied Mr. O'Moore. \"Now I am an Australian. But come in,\nwhoever you are, gentlemen; this house is at your service.\"\n\nThe invitation so hospitably given was accepted without ceremony. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant, conducted by Mrs. O'Moore, entered the house,\nwhile the colonist's sons relieved the visitors of their fire-arms.\n\nA large, cool, airy room occupied the ground-floor of the house,\nwhich was built of stout beams arranged horizontally. Several wooden\nbenches, built into the walls, and painted in gay colors, ten stools,\ntwo oaken trunks, in which white china and jugs of polished pewter were\narranged, and a long table, at which twenty people could be comfortably\nseated, constituted the furniture, worthy of the house and its hardy\ninhabitants.\n\nDinner was soon served. Dishes of soup smoked between roast beef and\nlegs of mutton, flanked by large plates of olives, grapes, and oranges.\nThe host and hostess had such an engaging air, and the fare was so\ntempting, so ample, and so abundantly furnished, that it would have\nbeen unbecoming not to accept this rural bounty. The domestics of the\nfarm, the equals of their master, had already come to partake of the\nrepast; and the host reserved the place of honor for the strangers.\n\n\"I expected you,\" said he, quietly, to Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\"You did?\" replied the latter, very much surprised.\n\n\"I always expect those who are coming,\" replied the Irishman.\n\nThen, in a grave voice, while his household stood respectfully, he\ninvoked a Divine blessing. Lady Helena was much affected by his perfect\nsimplicity of manner, and a look from her husband told her that he\nlikewise was touched by it.\n\n[Illustration: A fair and comfortable locality, which the merry mill\ncrowned with its pointed gable and caressed with the moving shadow of\nits sails.]\n\n[Sidenote: THE OLD QUESTION.]\n\nAmple justice was done to the repast. The conversation was general.\nThe colonist told his story. It was like that of most deserving and\nvoluntary emigrants. Many go far to seek their fortunes, and find\nonly sorrow and disaster; they accuse fate, forgetting to blame their\nignorance, laziness, and vices. The man who is sober and persevering,\neconomical and honest, is almost sure to succeed.\n\nThis had been the case with Mr. O'Moore. He had left Dundalk, where\nhe was poor, and, emigrating with his family to Australia, had landed\nat Adelaide. At first he engaged in mining, but soon relinquished\nthis for the less hazardous pursuits of the farmer, in which he had\nbeen successful beyond his highest anticipations. His agricultural\nknowledge was a great aid to him. He economized, and bought new lands\nwith the profits of the first. His family flourished, as well as his\nfarm. The Irish peasant had become a landed proprietor, and, although\nhis establishment was only two years old, he owned at that moment five\nhundred acres of well-cultivated land and five hundred head of cattle,\nwas his own master, and as independent as one can be even in the freest\ncountry in the world.\n\nHis guests congratulated him sincerely when his story was finished. He\ndoubtless expected a similar confidence, but did not urge it. Glenarvan\nhad an immediate interest in speaking of the Duncan, of his own\npresence at Cape Bernouilli, and of the search that they had pursued so\nperseveringly. But, like a man who considers the main object in view,\nhe first questioned his host concerning the shipwreck of the Britannia.\n\nThe Irishman's answer was not cheering. He had never heard of the\nship. No vessel had for some time been lost on the coast; and, as the\nshipwreck had occurred only two years before, he could affirm with\nabsolute certainty that the sailors had not been cast on that part of\nthe western shore.\n\n\"And now, my lord,\" added he, \"may I be allowed to ask why you have\ninquired of me concerning this shipwreck?\"\n\nGlenarvan then told the story of the document, the voyage of the\nDuncan, and the attempts made to find Captain Grant. He confessed that\nhis dearest hopes had been destroyed by Mr. O'Moore's discouraging\ninformation, and that he now despaired of ever finding the shipwrecked\nseamen of the Britannia.\n\nThese words produced a gloomy impression upon his hearers. Robert and\nMary listened to them with tearful eyes. Paganel could not find a word\nof consolation or hope. Captain Mangles suffered a grief that he could\nnot subdue. Despair was seizing upon the souls of the noble people whom\nthe Duncan had vainly brought to these distant shores, when all at once\na voice was heard:--\n\n\"My lord, praise and thank God! If Captain Grant is living, he is in\nAustralia.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nTHE QUARTERMASTER OF THE BRITANNIA.\n\n\nThe astonishment that these words produced cannot be described.\nGlenarvan sprang to his feet, and, pushing back his chair, cried,--\n\n\"Who says that?\"\n\n\"I!\" replied one of O'Moore's workmen, seated at the end of the table.\n\n\"You, Ayrton?\" said the colonist, no less astonished than Glenarvan.\n\n\"I,\" repeated Ayrton, in an excited but firm tone; \"I, a Scotchman like\nyourself, my lord, one of the shipwrecked sailors of the Britannia!\"\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH FACE.]\n\nMary Grant, half fainting with emotion, and overcome with happiness,\nsank into the arms of Lady Helena; while Captain Mangles, Robert, and\nPaganel went towards the man whom their host had called Ayrton.\n\nHe was a somewhat rough-looking, broad-shouldered man, of about\nforty-five, of more than medium height, and with piercing eyes sunk\ndeeply beneath his projecting brows. His strength must have been\nunusual, even considering his stature, for he was all bone and sinew.\nHis countenance, full of intelligence and energy, although the features\nwere stern, prepossessed one in his favor. The sympathy that he\nelicited was still more increased by the traces of recent hardships\nimprinted upon his face. It was evident that he had suffered much,\nalthough he seemed a man able to brave, endure, and conquer suffering.\n\nThe travelers felt all this at first sight. Ayrton's appearance had\ninterested them; and Glenarvan, acting as spokesman for all, pressed\nhim with inquiries. This strange meeting had evidently produced a\nbewildering effect, and the first questions were, to some extent,\nwithout order.\n\n\"You are one of the sailors of the Britannia?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord; Captain Grant's quartermaster,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Saved with him from the shipwreck?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. At that terrible moment I was washed overboard and cast\nashore.\"\n\n\"You are not one of the sailors, then, of whom the document makes\nmention?\"\n\n\"No; I did not know of the existence of such a document. The captain\nmust have thrown it overboard after I was gone.\"\n\n\"But the captain, the captain?\"\n\n\"I suppose he was lost, drowned, with the rest of the crew. I thought I\nwas the sole survivor.\"\n\n\"But you said that Captain Grant was living!\"\n\n[Illustration: He was a somewhat rough-looking, broad-shouldered man,\nof about forty-five.]\n\n[Illustration: \"When I was washed from the forecastle, as I was hauling\ndown the jib, the Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia,\nwhich was not two cable-lengths distant.\"]\n\n\"No. I said, 'if the captain is living'----\"\n\n\"'He is in Australia,' you added.\"\n\n\"He can be nowhere else.\"\n\n\"You do not know, then, where he is?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. I repeat that I thought he was buried in the waves or\ndashed upon the rocks. You say that perhaps he is still living.\"\n\n\"What do you know, then?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Simply this, that if Captain Grant is living he is in Australia.\"\n\n\"Where did the shipwreck take place?\" inquired the major.\n\nThis should have been the first question; but, in the excitement of the\nmoment, Glenarvan, anxious to know where Captain Grant was, had not\ninquired where the Britannia was lost. From this point the conversation\nassumed a more definite form, and soon the details of the complicated\nstory appeared clear and exact to the minds of Ayrton's hearers.\n\nTo the major's question Ayrton replied,--\n\n\"When I was washed from the forecastle, as I was hauling down the jib,\nthe Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia, which was not\ntwo cable-lengths distant. The shipwreck, therefore, took place at that\npoint.\"\n\n\"In latitude thirty-seven?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Thirty-seven,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"On the west coast?\"\n\n\"No. On the east coast.\"\n\n\"And when?\"\n\n\"On the night of June 27th, 1862.\"\n\n\"The same! the very same!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"You see, then, my lord,\" added Ayrton, \"that I was right in saying\nthat, if Captain Grant still lives, you must seek him in Australia.\"\n\n[Sidenote: OLD MEMORIES.]\n\n\"And we will seek, find, and save him, my friend!\" cried Paganel. \"Ah,\nprecious document!\" added he, with perfect simplicity: \"it must be\nconfessed that you have fallen into the hands of very sagacious people.\"", "No one noticed these flattering words of Paganel. Glenarvan, Lady\nHelena, Mary, and Robert had crowded around Ayrton, and eagerly clasped\nhis hands. It seemed as if the presence of this man was a guarantee of\nthe safety of Harry Grant. Since the sailor had escaped the dangers\nof shipwreck, why should not the captain be safe and sound? Ayrton\nrepeated his declaration that if Captain Grant were living he must be\nin Australia. He answered with remarkable intelligence and clearness\nthe many questions that were propounded to him. Miss Mary, while\nhe spoke, held one of his hands in her own. This sailor had been a\ncompanion of her father, one of the shipwrecked survivors of the\nBritannia. He had lived with Harry Grant, had sailed the seas with him,\nhad braved the same dangers! She could not withdraw her eyes from that\nweather-beaten face, and she wept with happiness.\n\nHitherto no one had thought of doubting the veracity of the\nquartermaster. Only the major, and perhaps Captain Mangles, questioned\nwhether Ayrton's story merited _entire_ confidence. This unexpected\nmeeting might be suspicious. To be sure, Ayrton had mentioned facts and\ndates that agreed, and striking particulars. But details, however exact\nthey may be, do not constitute a certainty; and generally, as we know,\nfalsehood endeavors to strengthen itself by its preciseness. MacNabb,\ntherefore, reserved his opinion.\n\n[Illustration: When he came to himself, he was in the hands of the\nnatives, who carried him into the interior of the country.]\n\nAs for Captain Mangles, his doubts did not stand long before the\nassertions of the sailor, and he considered him a real companion of\nCaptain Grant when he heard him speak to the young girl of her father.\nAyrton knew Mary and Robert perfectly. He had seen them at Glasgow\non the departure of the Britannia. He remembered that they had been\npresent at the farewell dinner given on board to the friends of the\ncaptain. Sheriff MacIntyre was one of the guests. Robert--scarcely\nten years old--had been confided to the care of Dick Turner, the\nboatswain, but had escaped from him and climbed to the top-sail\nyard-arm.\n\n[Illustration: At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the\nhospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.]\n\n\"It is true! it is true!\" cried Robert.\n\nThe quartermaster remembered, too, a thousand little circumstances\nto which he did not seem to attach so much importance as did Captain\nMangles. When he stopped, Mary said, in her sweet voice,--\n\n\"Mr. Ayrton, please tell us more about our father.\"\n\nAyrton acceded to the young girl's request. Glenarvan was reluctant to\ninterrupt him, and yet many more important questions thronged his mind.\nBut Lady Helena, pointing out to him Mary's joyful excitement, checked\nhis inquiries.\n\n[Sidenote: TWO YEARS OF SLAVERY.]\n\nThe quartermaster now told the story of the Britannia and her voyage\nacross the Pacific. During the period of a year Harry Grant landed\nat the principal ports of Oceanica, opposing unjustifiable captures,\nand often a victim to the hostility of unjust traders. He found,\nhowever, an important point on the western coast of Papua. Here the\nestablishment of a Scottish colony appeared to him feasible, and its\nprosperity assured. After examining Papua, the Britannia sailed to\nCallao for provisions, and left that port on the 30th of May, 1862, to\nreturn to Europe by the way of the Indian Ocean and the Cape. Three\nweeks after her departure, a terrible tempest disabled her. It became\nnecessary to cut away the masts. A leak was discovered in the hold,\nwhich they did not succeed in stopping. The crew were soon overtasked\nand exhausted. The pumps could not be worked. For eight days the\nvessel was at the mercy of the storm. There were six feet of water\nin her hold, and she gradually foundered. The boats had been washed\noverboard, and the crew had given themselves up for lost, when on the\nnight of June 22nd, as Paganel had rightly interpreted, they descried\nthe eastern coast of Australia. The vessel soon stranded. A violent\nshock was felt. At this moment Ayrton, borne by a wave, was cast into\nthe midst of the breakers, and lost all consciousness. When he came to\nhimself, he was in the hands of the natives, who carried him into the\ninterior of the country. Since then he had heard nothing more of the\nBritannia, and naturally supposed that she had been wrecked, with all\non board, on the dangerous reefs of Twofold Bay.\n\nThis was Ayrton's story, which elicited more than once exclamations of\nsympathy. The major could not justly doubt its correctness; and after\nthis recital the quartermaster's own experiences possessed a more real\ninterest. Indeed, thanks to the document, they no longer doubted that\nCaptain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors. From\nthe fate of the one they could fairly conjecture that of the other.\n\nAyrton was invited to tell of his own adventures, which was soon and\nsimply done. The shipwrecked sailor, prisoner of a native tribe, was\ncarried into the interior regions watered by the Darling. Here he led\na very wretched existence, because the tribe itself was miserable; but\nhe was not maltreated. For two long years he endured a painful slavery.\nHowever, the hope of regaining his liberty sustained his courage. He\nwatched for the least opportunity of escaping, although his flight\nwould plunge him into the midst of innumerable perils. One night\nin October he eluded the vigilance of the natives, and took refuge\nin the depths of extensive forests. For a month, living on roots,\nedible ferns, and the gum of the mimosa, often overcome by despair,\nhe wandered in those vast solitudes, with the sun as his guide by\nday and the stars by night. In this way he crossed marshes, rivers,\nmountains, in short, all that uninhabited portion of country that few\ntravelers have explored. At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest\nand intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house\nshall long be at his service.\"\n\nAyrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the\ntwo months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find\nwith him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\"\n\nThe sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you have suffered injuries?\" inquired Ayrton.\n\n\"Yes,\" replies the captain.", "\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you have suffered injuries?\" inquired Ayrton.\n\n\"Yes,\" replies the captain.\n\n\"Serious?\"\n\n\"No; but they necessitate repairs which cannot be made on board. One\nof the flanges of the screw is bent, and this work can be done only at\nMelbourne.\"\n\n\"Can you not sail?\" asked the quartermaster.\n\n\"Yes; but, if the wind is contrary, it would take considerable time\nto reach Twofold Bay, and at any rate we should have to return to\nMelbourne.\"\n\n\"Well, let the yacht go to Melbourne,\" said Paganel, \"and we will go\nwithout her to Twofold Bay.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"By crossing Australia, as we crossed South America.\"\n\n\"But the Duncan?\" added Ayrton, with singular persistency.\n\n\"The Duncan will join us, or we will join her, according to\ncircumstances. If Captain Grant is found during our journey, we will\nreturn together to Melbourne. If, on the contrary, we continue our\nsearch to the coast, the Duncan shall join us there. Who has any\nobjections to make to this plan? Have you, major?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied MacNabb, \"if it is practicable.\"\n\n\"So practicable,\" said Paganel, \"that I propose that Lady Helena and\nMiss Grant accompany us.\"\n\n\"Do you speak seriously, Paganel?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Quite seriously, my lord. It is a journey of three hundred and fifty\nmiles. At the rate of twelve miles a day it would last scarcely a\nmonth,--long enough to give time for repairing the Duncan.\"\n\n\"But the ferocious animals?\" said Glenarvan, wishing to state all\npossible objections.\n\n[Sidenote: OBSTACLES EXPLAINED AWAY.]\n\n\"There are none in Australia.\"\n\n\"But the savages?\"\n\n\"There are none in the course we shall take.\"\n\n\"Well, then, the convicts?\"\n\n\"There are no convicts in the southern provinces of Australia, but only\nin the eastern colonies.\"\n\n\"Mr. Paganel is perfectly right,\" said O'Moore; \"they have all left the\nsouthern provinces. Since I have lived on this farm, I have not heard\nof one.\"\n\n\"And, for my part, I never met one,\" added Ayrton.\n\n\"You see, my friends,\" continued Paganel, \"that there are few savages,\nno wild beasts, and no convicts. There are not many countries of Europe\nof which we could say as much. Well, is it agreed?\"\n\n\"What do you think, Helena?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"What we all think,\" replied she, turning towards her companions.\n\"Forward!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY.\n\n\nIt was not Glenarvan's habit to lose time in adopting and executing a\nplan. As soon as Paganel's proposal was accepted, he at once resolved\nthat the preparations for the journey should be completed as soon as\npossible.\n\nAnd what was to be the result of this search? The existence of\nHarry Grant seemed to have become undeniable, which increased the\nprobabilities of success. No one expected to find the captain exactly\non the line of the thirty-seventh parallel; but perhaps they would come\nupon traces of him, and, at all events, their course would bring them\nstraight to the scene of the shipwreck, which was the principal point.\n\nMoreover, if Ayrton would consent to join the travelers, to guide them\nthrough the forests, and to the eastern coast, there was another chance\nof success. Glenarvan felt the importance of this arrangement, and was\ntherefore particularly desirous of obtaining the services of Captain\nGrant's companion. He inquired of his host whether he was willing for\nhim to propose to Ayrton to accompany them. Mr. O'Moore consented,\nthough not without regret at losing so good an assistant.\n\n\"Well, Ayrton, will you aid us in our search for the sailors of the\nBritannia?\"\n\nThe quartermaster did not answer immediately; he seemed to hesitate for\na few moments, but finally, after reflecting, said:\n\n\"Yes, my lord, I will follow you; and, if I do not set you upon the\ntrack of Captain Grant, I will at least guide you to the place where\nhis vessel was wrecked.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"One question, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ask it.\"\n\n\"Where will you join the Duncan?\"\n\n\"At Melbourne, if we do not cross Australia; on the eastern coast, if\nour search is continued so far.\"\n\n\"But the captain of the Duncan?\"\n\n\"He will await my orders at Melbourne.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" said Ayrton; \"rely on me.\"\n\n\"I will,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\nThe quartermaster was heartily thanked by the travelers. Captain\nGrant's children lavished upon him their most grateful caresses. All\nwere delighted at his decision, except the colonist, who would lose\nin him an intelligent and faithful assistant. But he understood the\nimportance that Glenarvan attached to this new addition to his force,\nand was resigned. He had, moreover, engaged to furnish them with the\nmeans of conveyance for the journey, and, this business being settled,\nthe party returned on board.\n\n[Illustration: This business being settled, the party returned on\nboard.]\n\nEverything was now changed; all hesitation had vanished. These\ncourageous searchers were no longer to wander on blindly. Harry Grant,\nthey believed, had found a refuge on the continent, and each heart\nwas full of the satisfaction that certainty brings when it takes the\nplace of doubt. In two months, perhaps, the Duncan would land the lost\ncaptain on the shores of Scotland.\n\nWhen Captain Mangles seconded the proposal that they should attempt to\ncross Australia with the ladies, he supposed that this time he would\naccompany the expedition. He therefore consulted Glenarvan on the\nsubject, and brought forward various arguments in his own favor, such\nas his desire to take part in the search for his countryman, and his\nusefulness in the undertaking.\n\n\"One question, John,\" said Glenarvan. \"You have absolute confidence in\nyour mate?\"\n\n\"Absolute,\" replied he. \"Tom Austin is a good sailor. He will take the\nDuncan to Melbourne, repair her thoroughly, and bring her back at the\nappointed time. He is a man devoted to duty and discipline, and will\nnever take the responsibility of changing or delaying the execution of\nan order. You can rely upon him as fully as on myself.\"\n\n\"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan; \"you shall accompany us; for,\"\nadded he, smiling, \"you certainly ought to be present when we find Mary\nGrant's father.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord!\" murmured Captain Mangles, with something like a blush\nupon his swarthy cheeks.\n\n[Sidenote: A PALACE-CART.]\n\nThe next day the captain, accompanied by the carpenter and by the\nsailors loaded with provisions, returned to the farm of Mr. O'Moore,\nwho was to assist him in the preparations. All the family were waiting\nfor him, ready to work under his orders. Ayrton was there, and freely\ngave them the benefit of his experience. He and his employer were\nagreed on this point, that the ladies ought to make the journey in an\nox-cart, and the gentlemen on horseback. The colonist could procure\nthem the animals and vehicle.\n\nThe vehicle was a cart twenty feet long and covered with an awning,\nthe whole resting upon four wheels, without spokes, felloes, or tires.\nThe front wheels were a long way from the hind ones, and were joined\ntogether by a rude contrivance that made it impossible to turn short.\nTo the body of the cart was attached a pole thirty-five feet long, to\nwhich three pairs of oxen were coupled. The animals, thus arranged,\ndrew by means of a yoke across their necks, to which the bow was\nfastened with an iron pin. It required great skill to manage this long,\nnarrow, tottering vehicle, and guide the oxen by means of the whip.\nBut Ayrton had served his apprenticeship at O'Moore's farm, and his\nemployer guaranteed his dexterity. Upon him, therefore, devolved the\nduty of driving.\n\nThe cart, being without springs, was not very easy; but our travelers\nwere obliged to conform to circumstances as much as they could. As no\nchange was possible in its rude construction, Captain Mangles arranged\nthe interior in the most comfortable manner. He divided it into two\ncompartments by a wooden partition. The rear one was designed for\nthe provisions, the baggage, and Mr. Olbinett's portable kitchen,\nwhile the forward one was reserved exclusively for the ladies. The\ncarpenter converted it into a convenient chamber, covered it with a\nthick carpet, and furnished it with a dressing-table and two berths for\nLady Helena and Mary Grant. Thick leathern curtains secured privacy,\nwhen necessary, and were a protection against the chilliness of the\nnight. In rainy weather the men could find shelter under the awning;\nbut a tent was to serve this purpose at the time of encampment. Captain\nMangles succeeded in crowding into this narrow space all that two\nladies could need, and Lady Helena and Mary Grant did not greatly miss\nthe comfortable cabins of the Duncan.\n\n[Sidenote: A RETURN VISIT.]\n\nAs for the men, seven strong horses were apportioned to Lord\nGlenarvan, Paganel, Robert Grant, Major MacNabb, Captain Mangles,\nand the two sailors, Wilson and Mulready, who accompanied this new\nexpeditionary party. The horses and oxen grazed near at hand, and could\nbe easily collected at the moment of departure.\n\n[Illustration: The vehicle was a cart twenty feet long and covered with\nan awning, the whole resting upon four wheels, without spokes, felloes,\nor tires.]\n\nHaving made his arrangements, and given his orders to the carpenter,\nCaptain Mangles returned on board with the colonist's family, who\nwished to pay Lord Glenarvan a visit. Ayrton thought proper to join\nthem, and about four o'clock the captain crossed the gangway of the\nDuncan.", "Of course, Glenarvan invited his visitors to dinner, and they willingly\naccepted his return hospitality. Mr. O'Moore was amazed. The furniture\nof the cabins, the tapestry, the upholstery, and the fancy-work of\nmaple and ebony excited his admiration. Ayrton, on the contrary, gave\nonly a secondary attention to these costly luxuries. He first examined\nthe yacht from a sailor's point of view. He explored the hold; he\nwent down into the engine-room; he looked at the engine, inquired\nits effective power and consumption; he visited the coal-house, the\npantry, and the powder-magazine, and took particular interest in the\ngun-room and the mounted cannon in the forecastle. Glenarvan now had to\ndeal with a man who was a critical judge, as he could see by Ayrton's\nkeen inquiries. At last the quartermaster finished his exploration by\ninspecting the masts and rigging; and, after a few moments of general\nreview, said:\n\n\"You have a fine vessel, my lord.\"\n\n\"A good one, too,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"How many tons' burden is she?\"\n\n\"Two hundred and ten.\"\n\n\"Shall I be greatly mistaken,\" added Ayrton, \"if I say that the Duncan\ncan easily make fifteen knots an hour at full speed?\"\n\n\"Say seventeen,\" interposed the captain, \"and you will be nearer\nright.\"\n\n\"Seventeen!\" cried the quartermaster: \"why, then, no man-of-war, not\neven the best, could overtake her.\"\n\n\"Not one,\" said the captain. \"The Duncan is a real racing yacht, and is\nnot to be beaten in any way.\"\n\n\"Not even in sailing?\" asked Ayrton.\n\n\"Not even in sailing.\"\n\n\"Well, my lord, and you, captain, accept the compliments of a sailor\nwho knows what a vessel is worth.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Ayrton,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and now remain on board, and it\nwill be your own fault if the ship is not all you can desire.\"\n\n\"I will think of it, my lord,\" said the quartermaster, modestly.\n\nMr. Olbinett now approached, and informed Lord Glenarvan that dinner\nwas ready; and they all adjourned to the saloon.\n\n\"That Ayrton is an intelligent man,\" said Paganel to the major.\n\n\"Too intelligent!\" growled MacNabb, who, without any apparent reason,\ndisliked the looks and manners of the quartermaster.\n\nDuring dinner, Ayrton gave some interesting information concerning\nAustralia, with which he was perfectly familiar. He inquired the number\nof sailors that Glenarvan intended to take with him in his expedition.\nWhen he learned that only two, Wilson and Mulready, were to accompany\nthem, he seemed astonished. He advised Glenarvan to form his party of\nthe best seamen of the Duncan. He even insisted upon this point, which\nmust have removed all suspicion from the mind of the major.\n\n\"But,\" said Glenarvan, \"is there any danger in our journey across\nAustralia?\"\n\n\"None,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n[Sidenote: A CHANGE OF RESIDENCE.]\n\n\"Well, then, let us leave on board as many as possible. There must be\nmen to navigate the Duncan and take charge of her. It is especially\nimportant that she should arrive promptly at the place of meeting,\nwhich we will appoint hereafter. Let us not, therefore, lessen the\ncrew.\"\n\nAyrton seemed to appreciate this reason, and no longer insisted.\n\nAt evening the party separated. Ayrton and O'Moore's family returned to\ntheir home. The horses and cart were to be ready the next day, and the\ntravelers were to start at eight o'clock in the morning.\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant now made their last preparations, which were\nshort and less minute than those of Jacques Paganel. The geographer\npassed half the night in unscrewing, cleaning, and screwing on again\nthe lenses of his telescope. He was still asleep the next morning, when\nthe major awoke him early with a loud summons.\n\nThe baggage had already been conveyed to the farm through the care of\nCaptain Mangles. A boat was waiting for the travelers, and they were\nnot long in embarking. The young captain gave his last orders to Tom\nAustin, and instructed him above all to await the commands of Lord\nGlenarvan at Melbourne, and execute them scrupulously whatever they\nmight be. The trusty sailor replied that they might rely on him. In the\nname of the crew he offered to his lordship their best wishes for the\nsuccess of the expedition. The boat put off, and a thunder of applause\nrent the air. In a few moments the party reached the shore, and in no\ngreat length of time arrived at O'Moore's farm.\n\nEverything was ready. Lady Helena was delighted with her quarters. The\nimmense cart, with its rude wheels and massive timbers, especially\npleased her. The six oxen yoked in pairs seemed to indicate primeval\nsimplicity, and were a novel sight. Ayrton, whip in hand, awaited the\norders of his new chief.\n\n[Illustration: Ayrton and Olbinett took their places respectively in\nfront and in the rear part of the cart, while Glenarvan, the major,\nPaganel, Robert, Captain Mangles, and the two sailors, mounted their\nhorses.]\n\n\"I declare!\" said Paganel, \"this is an admirable vehicle, worth all the\nmail-coaches in the world. I know of no better way of traversing the\nearth than in this style, like mountebanks. A house that moves when\nyou please and stops wherever you please is all you can desire.\"\n\n[Illustration: The \"Mosquito Plains,\" whose very name describes them,\nand serves to tell of the tortures that our friends had to encounter.]\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel,\" replied Lady Helena, \"I hope to have the pleasure\nof receiving you in my parlor.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied the geographer, \"you do me great honor! Have you\nchosen a day?\"\n\n\"I shall be at home every day for my friends,\" replied Lady Helena,\nsmiling, \"and you are----\"\n\n\"The most devoted of all,\" added Paganel, gallantly.\n\nThis exchange of compliments was interrupted by the arrival of seven\nhorses, all harnessed, driven by one of O'Moore's sons. Lord Glenarvan\npaid for these new acquisitions, and added many thanks, which the\nhonest colonist seemed to value as highly as the gold and notes which\nhe received.\n\nThe signal for departure was now given. Lady Helena and Miss Grant\nseated themselves in their compartment, Ayrton and Olbinett took their\nplaces respectively in front and in the rear part of the cart, while\nGlenarvan, the major, Paganel, Robert, Captain Mangles, and the two\nsailors, all armed with carbines and revolvers, mounted their horses. A\n\"God bless you\" was Mr. O'Moore's parting salute, which was echoed in\nchorus by his family. Ayrton uttered a peculiar cry, and started his\nlong team. The cart moved, the timbers cracked, the axles creaked, and\nthe farm of the honest hospitable Irishman soon disappeared from view\nat the turn of the road.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nAN ACCIDENT.\n\n\nOur travelers made tolerably good progress by their new mode of\nconveyance. The heat was great, but endurable, and the road was\nquite easy for the horses. They were still in the province of South\nAustralia, and in this part at least the scenery was not of the\nmost interesting character. A succession of small hills, with very\ndusty tracks, small shrubs, and scant herbage, had to be traversed\nfor several miles; and when these had been passed they reached the\n\"Mosquito Plains,\" whose very name describes them, and serves to tell\nof the tortures that our friends had to encounter. Both the bipeds and\nthe quadrupeds suffered terribly from the infliction of these flying\npests, whom to avoid was impossible; but there was some consolation for\nthe former in the spirits of hartshorn, carried in the medicine-chest,\nwhich alleviated the pain caused by the sting of those whom Paganel was\ncontinually consigning to a place and person whom they would not visit.\n\nBut shortly a more pleasant neighborhood was reached. Hedges of\nacacias, then a newly cut and better made roadway, then European\nimported trees--oaks, olives, and lemons,--then a well-kept fence,--all\nthese signs told of their approach to Red-gum Station, the home and\nsettlement of an emigrant engaged in the cattle-breeding which is the\nsource of so much Australian wealth. It was in itself an establishment\nof small importance; but to its owners it was a home, and to its\nvisitors, on this occasion, it was a hotel, as the \"station\" generally\nis to the traveler.\n\n[Illustration: Red-gum Station, the home and settlement of an emigrant\nengaged in the cattle-breeding which is the source of so much\nAustralian wealth.]\n\n[Illustration: The major was skillful enough to shoot a very rare\nbird,--a \"jabiru,\" or giant crane. This creature was five feet high;\nand its broad, black, sharp conical beak measured eighteen inches in\nlength.]\n\nGlenarvan's party invariably found beneath the roof of these solitary\nsettlers a well-spread and hospitable table; and in the Australian\nfarmer they always met an obliging host.\n\nAfter a night spent at this resting-place the party advanced through a\ngrove, and at evening encamped on the shores of a brackish and muddy\nlake. Mr. Olbinett prepared supper with his usual promptness, and the\ntravelers--some in the cart and others under the tent--were not long\nin falling asleep, in spite of the dismal howlings of the dingos,--the\njackals of Australia.\n\nThe next morning Glenarvan and his companions were greeted with a\nmagnificent sight. As far as the eye could reach, the landscape seemed\nto be one flowery meadow in spring-like luxuriance. The delicate blue\nof the slender-leaved flax-plant mingled with the flaming scarlet\nof the acanthus, and the ground was clothed with a rich carpet of\ngreen and crimson. After a rapid journey of about ten miles, the cart\nwound through tall groups of acacias, mimosas, and white gum-trees.\nThe vegetable kingdom on these plains did not show itself ungrateful\ntowards the orb of day, and repaid in perfume and color what it\nreceived in sunshine.", "As for the animal kingdom, it was no less lavish of its products.\nSeveral cassowaries bounded over the plain with unapproachable\nswiftness. The major was skillful enough to shoot a very rare bird,--a\n\"jabiru,\" or giant crane. This creature was five feet high; and its\nbroad, black, sharp conical beak measured eighteen inches in length.\nThe violet and purple colors of its head contrasted strongly with the\nlustrous green of its neck, the dazzling white of its breast, and the\nvivid red of its long legs.\n\n[Sidenote: A FOUR-FOOTED ARMY.]\n\nThis bird was greatly admired, and the major would have won the honors\nof the day, if young Robert had not encountered a few miles farther\non, and bravely vanquished, an unsightly beast, half hedgehog, half\nant-eater, a chaotic-looking animal, like those of pre-historic\nperiods. A long, glutinous, extensible tongue hung out of its mouth,\nand fished up the ants that constituted its principal food. Of course,\nPaganel wished to carry away the hideous creature, and proposed to\nput it in the baggage-room; but Mr. Olbinett opposed this with such\nindignation that the geographer gave up his idea of preserving this\ncurious specimen.\n\nHitherto few colonists or squatters had been seen. The country seemed\ndeserted. There was not even the trace of a native; for the savage\ntribes wander farther to the north, over the immense wastes watered by\nthe Darling and the Murray. But now a singular sight was presented to\nGlenarvan's party. They were fortunate enough to see one of those vast\nherds of cattle which bold speculators bring from the eastern mountains\nto the provinces of Victoria and South Australia.\n\nAbout four o'clock in the afternoon, Captain Mangles descried, three\nmiles in advance, an enormous column of dust that spread along the\nhorizon. What occasioned this? It would have been very difficult to\nsay. Paganel was inclined to regard it as some phenomenon, for which\nhis lively imagination already sought a natural cause. But Ayrton\ndissipated all his conjectures by declaring that this cloud of dust\nproceeded from a drove of cattle.\n\nThe quartermaster was not mistaken. The thick cloud approached, from\nthe midst of which issued a chorus of bleatings, neighings, and\nbellowings, while the human voice mingled in cries and whistles with\nthis pastoral symphony. A man emerged from the noisy multitude; it was\nthe commander-in-chief of this four-footed army. Glenarvan advanced to\nmeet him, and friendly relations were established without ceremony.\nThe leader, or, to give him his real title, the \"stock-keeper,\" was\nproprietor of a part of the herd. His name was Sam Machell, and he\nwas on his way from the eastern provinces to Portland Bay. His cattle\ncomprised one thousand oxen, eleven thousand sheep, and seventy-five\nhorses. All these animals, bought when lean on the plains of the\nBlue Mountains, were to be fattened in the healthy pastures of South\nAustralia, where they would be sold for a large price.\n\nSam Machell briefly told his story, while the drove continued its\ncourse through the clumps of mimosas. Lady Helena, Mary Grant, and\nthe horsemen dismounted, and, seated in the shade of a huge gum-tree,\nlistened to the stock-keeper's narrative.\n\nHe had set out seven months before, and had made about ten miles a day,\nat which rate his journey would last three months longer. To aid him\nin this laborious task, he had with him twenty dogs and thirty men.\nFive of the men were blacks, who are very skillful in recovering stray\nanimals. Six carts followed the drove; and the drivers, provided with\nstock-whips, the handles of which were eighteen inches and the lashes\nnine feet in length, moved among the ranks and maintained order, while\nthe canine light dragoons hovered about on the wings.\n\nThe travelers were amazed at the discipline of this novel army. The\ndifferent classes advanced separately, for wild oxen and sheep do\nnot associate well; the first will never graze where the second have\npassed. Hence it was necessary to place the oxen at the head; and these\naccordingly, divided into two battalions, took the lead. Five regiments\nof sheep, commanded by five drivers, followed, and the platoon of\nhorses formed the rear-guard.\n\nThe stock-keeper observed to his hearers that the leaders of the army\nwere neither dogs nor men, but oxen, whose superiority was recognized\nby their mates. They advanced in the front rank with perfect gravity,\nchoosing the best course by instinct, and thoroughly convinced of their\nright to be treated with consideration.\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNFORESEEN HINDRANCE.]\n\nThus the discipline was maintained, for the drove obeyed them without\nresistance. If it pleased them to stop, the others were obliged to\nyield, and it was useless to attempt to resume the line of march if the\nleaders did not give the signal.\n\nSuch was Sam Machell's account, during which a great part of the\nherd had advanced in good order. It was now time for him to join his\narmy, and choose the best pastures. He therefore took leave of Lord\nGlenarvan, mounted a fine native horse that one of his men was holding\nfor him, and a few moments after had disappeared in a cloud of dust,\nwhile the cart, resuming its interrupted journey, stopped at nightfall\nat the foot of Mount Talbot.\n\nThe next day they reached the shores of the Wimerra, which is half a\nmile wide, and flows in a limpid stream between tall rows of gum-trees\nand acacias. Magnificent myrtles raised aloft their long, drooping\nbranches, adorned with crimson flowers, while thousands of goldfinches,\nchaffinches, and golden-winged pigeons, not to speak of chattering\nparrots, fluttered about in the foliage. Below, on the surface of the\nstream, sported a pair of black swans, shy and unapproachable.\n\nMeantime the cart had stopped on a carpet of turf whose fringes hung\nover the swiftly flowing waters. There was neither raft nor bridge, but\nthey must cross at all hazard. Ayrton busied himself in searching for\na practicable ford. A quarter of a mile up-stream, the river seemed to\nhim less deep, and from this point he resolved to reach the other bank.\nVarious soundings gave a depth of only three feet. The cart could,\ntherefore, pass over this shallow without running much risk.\n\n\"Is there no other way of crossing the river?\" asked Glenarvan of the\nquartermaster.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied Ayrton; \"but this passage does not seem to me\ndangerous. We can extricate ourselves from any difficulty.\"\n\n\"Shall Lady Helena and Miss Grant leave the cart?\"\n\n\"Not at all. My oxen are sure-footed, and I will engage to keep them in\nthe right track.\"\n\n\"Well, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"I trust to you.\"\n\nThe horsemen surrounded the heavy vehicle, and the party boldly entered\nthe river. Usually, when these fordings are attempted, the carts are\nencircled by a ring of empty barrels, which support them on the water.\nBut here this buoyant girdle was wanting, and it was, therefore,\nnecessary to confide to the sagacity of the oxen, guided by the\ncautious Ayrton. The major and the two sailors dashed through the rapid\ncurrent some distance ahead, while Glenarvan and Captain Mangles, one\non each side of the cart, stood ready to assist the ladies, and Paganel\nand Robert brought up the rear.\n\nEverything went well till they reached the middle of the river, but\nhere the depth increased, and the water rose above the felloes. The\noxen, if thrown out of their course, might lose their footing and\noverturn the unsteady vehicle. Ayrton exerted himself to the utmost. He\nleaped into the water, and, seizing the oxen by the horns, succeeded in\nkeeping them in the right track.\n\nAt this moment an accident, impossible to foresee, took place. A crack\nwas heard; the cart inclined at an alarming angle; the water reached\nthe feet of the ladies, and the whole vehicle threatened to give way.\nIt was an anxious moment.\n\nFortunately a vigorous blow upon the yoke brought the cart nearer the\nshore. The river grew shallower, and soon men and beasts were in safety\non the opposite bank. Only the front wheels of the cart were damaged,\nand Glenarvan's horse had lost the shoes of his fore-feet.\n\nThis mishap required immediate repair. The travelers gazed at each\nother in some degree of perplexity, when Ayrton proposed to go to Black\nPoint Station, twenty miles to the north, and bring a farrier.\n\n[Sidenote: FOOD, PHYSICAL AND MENTAL.]\n\n\"Very well, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan. \"How much time do you need to make\nthe journey and return to the encampment?\"\n\n\"Fifteen hours,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Go, then; and, while waiting for your return, we will encamp on the\nbanks of the Wimerra.\"\n\nA few moments after, the quartermaster, mounted on Wilson's horse,\ndisappeared behind the thick curtain of mimosas.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nAUSTRALIAN EXPLORERS.\n\n\nAfter the departure of Ayrton, and during this compulsory halt,\npromenades and conversations became the order of the day. There was\nan abundance of agreeable surroundings to talk about, and nature\nseemed dressed in one of her most attractive garbs. Birds, novel and\nvaried in their plumage, with flowers such as they had never before\ngazed on, were the constant theme of the travelers' remark; and when,\nin addition, they had in Mr. Olbinett one who knew how to spread\nbefore them and make the best of all the culinary novelties that were\nwithin reach, a very substantial foundation was possible for the\n\"feast of reason and the flow of soul\" which followed, and for which,\nas usual, they were to no small extent indebted to their learned\nhistorico-geographical professor, whose stock of information was as\nvaried as it was pleasant.\n\n[Illustration: A crack was heard; the cart inclined at an alarming\nangle; the water reached the feet of the ladies, and the whole vehicle\nthreatened to give way. It was an anxious moment.]", "[Illustration: A crack was heard; the cart inclined at an alarming\nangle; the water reached the feet of the ladies, and the whole vehicle\nthreatened to give way. It was an anxious moment.]\n\nAfter dinner the traveling party had, as if in anticipation, seated\nthemselves at the foot of a magnificent banksia; the young moon was\nrising high into the heavens, lengthening the twilight, and prolonging\nit into the evening hour; whilst the smoke of the major's cigar was\nseen curling upwards, losing itself in the foliage of the tree.\n\n\n[Illustration: After dinner the traveling party had, as if in\nanticipation, seated themselves at the foot of a magnificent banksia;\nthe young moon was rising high into the heavens, lengthening the\ntwilight, and prolonging it into the evening hour.]\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel,\" said Lady Helena, \"you have never given us the\nhistory that you promised when you supplied us with that long list of\nnames.\"\n\nThe gentleman addressed did not require any lengthened entreaties on\nthis subject, but, with an attentive auditory, and in the grandest\nof all lecture-rooms, he rehearsed to them the two great dramas of\nAustralian travel, which have made the names of Burke and Stuart\nimmortal in the history of that continent.\n\nHe told them that it was on the 20th of August, 1860, that Robert\nO'Hara Burke set out, under the auspices of the Royal Society of\nMelbourne, to cross the continent from south to north, and so to reach\nthe Indian Ocean. Eleven others--including a botanist, an astronomer,\nand an army officer--accompanied him, with horses and other beasts of\nburden. But the expedition did not long continue so numerous or so well\nprovided; in consequence of misunderstandings, several returned, and\nBurke pressed on with but few followers and fewer aids. Again, on the\n20th of November, he still further diminished his numbers by leaving\nbehind at an encampment several of his companions, that he and three\nothers might press on towards the north with as little incumbrance as\npossible. After a very painful journey across a stony desert, they\narrived at the extreme point reached by Stuart in 1845; and from this\npoint, after determining as accurately as possible their latitude and\nlongitude, they again started northward and seaward.\n\n[Sidenote: LYING DOWN TO DIE.]\n\nBy the 7th of January they had gone so far as to reach the southern\nlimit of the tropical heat; and now under a scorching sun, deceived by\nthe mirage, often without water, and then hailing a storm as a source\nof refreshment, now and then meeting with the aborigines, who could in\nno wise help them, they had indeed a hard road to travel, though having\nneither rivers, lakes, nor mountains to bar their path.\n\nAt length, however, there were various signs that they were approaching\nthe sea; by-and-by they reached the bank of a river which flows into\nthe Gulf of Carpentaria; and finally Burke and Wills, after terrible\nhardships, arrived at the point where the sea-water flowed up to and\ninundated the marshes, though the sea-shore itself they did not reach.\nWith naught but barrenness in sight on either hand, their great desire\nwas to get back and rejoin their companions; but peril after peril\nawaited them, many of which their note-book has preserved an account\nof, but many more will be forever unrecorded. The three survivors\n(for one of the party had succumbed to the hardships) now strained\nevery effort to reach the encampment, where they hoped to find their\ncompanions and a store of provisions. On the 21st of April they\ngained the goal, but the prize was missing; only seven hours before,\nafter five months of waiting in vain, their companions had taken\ntheir departure. Of course nothing remained but to follow them with\ntheir feeble strength and scanty means of subsistence; but calamities\nstill dogged their footsteps, and at last the leader, Burke, lay down\nexhausted, saying to his companion, King, \"I have not many hours to\nlive; here are my watch and my notes; when I am dead, place a pistol\nin my right hand, and leave me without burial.\" His forebodings were\nrealized, and the next morning he died. King, in despair, went in\nsearch of some Australian tribe, for now Wills had begun to sink,\nand he shortly afterwards died also. At length the sole survivor was\nrescued by an expedition sent out in search of Burke; and thus the sad\ntale was told of this Australian tragedy.\n\n[Illustration: \"When I am dead, place a pistol in my right hand, and\nleave me without burial.\" His forebodings were realized, and the next\nmorning he died.]\n\nThe narrative concerning Stuart was a less melancholy one, though the\ntrials endured on his expedition were likewise great. Aided by the\nparliament of South Australia, he likewise proceeded northward,\nin the year 1862, about seven degrees to the west of the line taken\nby Burke. He found his route to be a more accessible and easy one\nthan the other, and was rewarded for his toil when, on the 24th of\nJuly, he beheld the waters of the Indian Ocean, and proudly unfurled\nthe Australian flag from the topmost branch of the highest tree he\ncould find. His return to the inhabited regions was successfully\naccomplished, and his entry into Adelaide, on the 17th of December, was\nan ovation indeed. But his health was shattered, and, after receiving\nthe gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society, and returning to his\nnative Scotland, he died on the 5th of June, 1866.\n\n[Illustration: He beheld the waters of the Indian Ocean, and proudly\nunfurled the Australian flag from the topmost branch of the highest\ntree he could find.]\n\nThe histories of these Australian travels were lengthy, as told by\nPaganel. When he had finished, hope and despair seemed to fight for the\nmastery in the breasts of his listeners; but they did not fight long,\nfor peaceful slumbers soon enwrapped the company, except those whose\nturn it was to watch over their fellow-travelers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nCRIME OR CALAMITY?\n\n\n[Sidenote: THE MISCHIEF REPAIRED.]\n\nIt was not without a certain feeling of apprehension that the major\nhad seen Ayrton leave the Wimerra to procure a farrier at Black Point\nStation. However, he did not breathe a word of his personal suspicions,\nbut contented himself with exploring the surroundings of the river,\nwhose tranquillity was undisturbed. As for Glenarvan, his only fear was\nto see Ayrton return alone. In the absence of skilled labor, the cart\ncould not resume its journey, which would be interrupted for several\ndays perhaps; and his longings for success and eagerness to attain his\nend admitted of no delay.\n\nFortunately, Ayrton had lost neither his time nor his trouble. The\nnext morning he reappeared at break of day. A man accompanied him, by\nprofession a farrier. He was a tall, stout fellow, but of a low and\nbrutish appearance, which did not prepossess one in his favor. However,\nthis was of little importance, if he knew his business. At all events\nhis breath was not wasted in idle words.\n\n\"Is he an efficient workman?\" inquired Captain Mangles of the\nquartermaster.\n\n\"I know no more than you, captain,\" replied Ayrton. \"We shall see.\"\n\nThe farrier began his work. He was a man who understood his trade, as\none could see by the way in which he repaired the wheels of the cart.\nHe labored skillfully and with uncommon energy.\n\nDuring the operation, the major noticed that the farrier's wrists were\nconsiderably eroded, and that they were each encircled by a blackish\nring of extravasated blood. These were the marks of recent wounds,\nwhich the sleeves of a miserable woolen shirt but partially concealed.\nMacNabb questioned the man about these erosions, which must have been\nvery painful. He, however, made no reply, but stolidly kept on at his\nwork.\n\nTwo hours after, the injuries of the cart were repaired. As for\nGlenarvan's horse, he was quickly shod. The farrier had taken care to\nbring shoes all prepared. There was a peculiarity about them, however,\nwhich did not escape the major. It was a trefoil rudely carved on the\nouter rim. He pointed it out to Ayrton.\n\n\"It is the Black Point mark,\" replied the quartermaster, \"which enables\nthem to follow the tracks of the horses that stray from the station,\nand not confound them with others.\"\n\nThe farrier, having done all that was required of him, now claimed his\nwages, and departed without having spoken four words.\n\nHalf an hour later, the travelers were on the move. Beyond the curtain\nof mimosas extended a broad, uncovered space, which justly deserved its\nname of \"open plain.\" Fragments of quartz and ferruginous rocks lay\namong the bushes, tall grass, and hedgerows that protected numerous\nflocks. Several miles farther on, the wheels of the cart sank deeply\nin the marshy lowlands, through which ran winding creeks, half hidden\nbeneath a canopy of gigantic rushes. The journey, notwithstanding, was\nneither difficult nor tedious.\n\nLady Helena invited the horsemen to call upon her in turn, for her\nparlor was very small. Each was thus relieved from the fatigue of\nhorseback riding, and enjoyed the society of this amiable lady,\nwho, assisted by Miss Mary, performed with perfect grace the honors\nof her movable mansion. Captain Mangles was not forgotten in these\ninvitations, and his rather sober conversation was not at all\ndispleasing.\n\nAt eleven o'clock they arrived at Carlsbrook, quite an important\nmunicipality. Ayrton thought it best to pass by the city without\nentering. Glenarvan was of the same opinion; but Paganel, always\neager for something new, desired to visit the place. Accordingly,\nthe geographer, taking Robert with him as usual, started on his\nexplorations, while the cart slowly continued its journey. Their\ninspection of the town was very rapid, and shortly afterwards they had\njoined their companions.", "While they were passing through this region, the travelers requested\nPaganel to give them some account of its progress, and the geographer,\nin compliance with their wishes, had just begun a lecture upon the\ncivilization of the country, when he was interrupted by a shrill\nwhistle. The party were not a mile from the railroad. A locomotive,\ncoming from the south, and going slowly, had stopped just where\nthe road they were following crossed the iron track. At this point\nthe railway passes over the Lutton on an iron bridge, and thither\nAyrton directed his cart, preceded by the horsemen. The travelers\nwere attracted, moreover, by a lively feeling of curiosity, for\na considerable crowd was already rushing towards the bridge. The\ninhabitants of the neighboring stations, leaving their houses, and the\nshepherds their flocks, lined the sides of the track. Frequent cries\nwere heard. Some serious event must have taken place to cause such\nexcitement,--a great accident, perhaps.\n\n[Illustration: A terrible accident had occurred, not a collision, but a\nrunning off the track and a fall into the river, which was filled with\nthe fragments of cars and locomotives.]\n\nGlenarvan, followed by his companions, urged on his horse, and in a few\nmoments arrived at Camden Bridge. Here the cause of this agitation was\nat once manifest. A terrible accident had occurred, not a collision,\nbut a running off the track and a fall into the river, which was filled\nwith the fragments of cars and locomotives. Either the bridge had\ngiven way, or the engine had run off the track; for five coaches out\nof six had been precipitated into the bed of the Lutton. The last car,\nmiraculously preserved by the breaking of its coupling, stood on the\nvery verge of the abyss. Below was to be seen nothing but a terrible\nheap of blackened and bent axle-trees, broken cars, twisted rails, and\ncharred timbers. The boiler, which had burst at the shock, had thrown\nits iron plates to an enormous distance. From this mass of unsightly\nobjects issued flames and spiral wreaths of steam, mingled with black\nsmoke. Large spots of blood, scattered limbs, and trunks of burnt\nbodies appeared here and there; and no one dared to estimate the number\nof victims buried beneath the ruins.\n\nGlenarvan, Paganel, the major, and Captain Mangles mingled with the\ncrowd, and listened to the conjectures that passed from one to another.\nEach sought to explain the catastrophe, while laboring to save what was\nleft.\n\n\"The bridge has broken,\" said one.\n\n[Sidenote: CAUSES AND EFFECTS.]\n\n\"Broken?\" replied others. \"That cannot be, for it is still uninjured.\nThey forgot to close it for the passage of the train, that is all.\"\n\nIt was a draw-bridge, which had been constructed for the convenience of\nthe shipping. Had the man on guard, through unpardonable negligence,\nforgotten to close it, and thus precipitated the train, at full speed,\ninto the bed of the Lutton? This supposition seemed plausible, for one\nhalf of the bridge lay beneath the fragments of the cars, while the\nother still hung intact in its chains. Doubt was no longer possible;\nsurely carelessness must have caused the calamity.\n\nThe accident had happened to the night express, which left Melbourne\nat forty-five minutes past eleven. It must have been a quarter-past\nthree in the morning when the train reached Camden Bridge, where this\nterrible destruction of life and property took place. The travelers\nand employ\u00e9s of the last car at once busied themselves in seeking\nassistance; but the telegraph-wires, whose poles lay on the ground,\nwere no longer available. It took the authorities of Castlemaine three\nhours to reach the scene of the disaster; and it was, therefore, six\no'clock in the morning before a corps of workers was organized under\nthe direction of the surveyor-general of the district, and a detachment\nof policemen, commanded by an officer. The squatters had come to their\naid, and exerted themselves to extinguish the fire, which consumed the\nheap of ruins with unconquerable fierceness. Several unrecognizable\nbodies lay on the edge of the embankment, but it was impossible\nto rescue a living being from this furnace. The fire had rapidly\naccomplished the work of destruction. Of the travelers in the train,\nwhose number was not known, only ten survived, those in the last car.\nThe railroad company had just sent an extra locomotive to convey them\nto Castlemaine.\n\nMeantime, Lord Glenarvan, having made the acquaintance of the\nsurveyor-general, was conversing with him and the police-officer. The\nlatter was a tall, thin man, of imperturbable coolness, who, if he\nhad any feeling, betrayed no sign of it on his impassible features.\nHe was like a mathematician engaged upon a problem; he was seeking to\nelucidate the mystery of the disaster. To Glenarvan's first words,\n\"This is a great calamity!\" he replied, calmly, \"It is more than that.\"\n\n\"More than that!\" cried Glenarvan; \"and what can be more than that?\"\n\n\"It is a crime!\" replied the officer, coolly.\n\nGlenarvan turned to Mr. Mitchell, the surveyor-general, with a\nquestioning look.\n\n\"That is correct,\" said the latter; \"our examination has convinced us\nthat the catastrophe is the result of a crime. The last baggage-wagon\nwas robbed. The surviving travelers were attacked by a party of five or\nsix malefactors. The bridge was opened intentionally; and, taking into\naccount this fact with the disappearance of the guard, I cannot but\ncome to the conclusion that the miserable man was the accomplice of the\ncriminals.\"\n\nThe police-officer, at these words, slowly shook his head.\n\n\"You are not of my opinion?\" inquired Mr. Mitchell.\n\n\"Not as regards the complicity of the guard.\"\n\n\"At any rate, this assumed complicity,\" continued the surveyor-general,\n\"enables us to attribute the crime to the natives who wander about the\ncountry. Without the guard's assistance these natives could not have\nopened the draw-bridge, for they do not understand its working.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied the officer.\n\n\"Now, it is known,\" added Mr. Mitchell, \"from the testimony of a\nboatman, whose boat passed Camden Bridge at forty minutes past ten in\nthe evening, that the bridge was closed according to regulation, after\nhis passage.\"\n\n\"Quite right.\"\n\n[Illustration: In the midst of the multitude two men were bearing a\ncorpse. It was that of the guard, already cold. A poniard-thrust had\npierced him to the heart.]\n\n\"Therefore the complicity of the guard seems to me to be proved\nincontestably.\"\n\nThe officer again made a gesture of dissent.\n\n\"Then you do not attribute the crime to the natives?\" inquired\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"I do not.\"\n\n\"To whom, then?\"\n\nAt this moment a loud uproar was heard half a mile up the river. A\ncrowd had formed, which rapidly increased, and was now approaching the\nstation. In the midst of the multitude two men were bearing a corpse.\nIt was that of the guard, already cold. A poniard-thrust had pierced\nhim to the heart. The assassins had dragged the body some distance from\nCamden Bridge, doubtless intending by this means to mislead the police\nin their first investigations. This discovery clearly justified the\ndoubts of the officer. The natives had no hand in the crime.\n\n\"Those who struck the blow,\" said he, \"are persons already familiar\nwith the use of these little instruments.\"\n\nAs he spoke he displayed a pair of \"darbies,\" a kind of manacles\nconsisting of a double ring of iron, furnished with a padlock.\n\n\"Before long,\" added he, \"I shall have the pleasure of presenting them\nwith these bracelets as a new year's gift.\"\n\n\"Then you suspect----?\"\n\n\"People who have 'traveled free on Her Majesty's vessels.'\"\n\n\"What! convicts?\" cried Paganel, who recognized the phrase employed in\nthe Australian colonies.\n\n\"I thought,\" observed Glenarvan, \"that those who have been transported\nhad no right to stay in the province of Victoria.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" replied the officer, \"if they have not the right, they take\nit! Sometimes they escape; and, if I am not greatly mistaken, these\nfellows have come direct from Perth. Well, they shall return again, you\nmay be sure.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A RAILROAD SLEEPER.]\n\nMr. Mitchell nodded approvingly at the words of the officer. At this\nmoment the cart arrived at the railroad crossing. Glenarvan, wishing\nto spare the ladies the spectacle at Camden Bridge, took leave of the\nsurveyor-general, and made a sign to his companions to follow him.\n\n\"There is no occasion,\" said he, \"for us to interrupt our journey.\"\n\nOn reaching the cart, Glenarvan simply told Lady Helena that a railroad\naccident had taken place, without mentioning the part that the convicts\nhad played in the catastrophe. He reserved this matter that he might\nquestion Ayrton in private. The little party then crossed the track,\nnot far above the bridge, and resumed their route towards the east.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nFRESH FACES.\n\n\nThey had not proceeded far before they reached a native cemetery,\npleasantly situated and with abundance of shady trees. Here for a\ntime they halted, and, whilst Robert and Paganel were exploring, Lord\nand Lady Glenarvan almost stumbled over a queer object. It was human,\nindigenous, and sleeping; but at first this was all that they could\ndecide, until, as the eyes opened and the sleeper roused to active\nlife, they saw before them a boy of eight years, with a notice pinned\nto the back of his jacket which read as follows: \"TOLIN\u00c9*, to be\nconducted to Echuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter. Prepaid.\"\n\n[Illustration: A boy of eight years, with a notice pinned to the back\nof his jacket which read as follows: \"Tolin\u00e9, to be conducted to\nEchuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter. Prepaid.\"]", "[Illustration: A boy of eight years, with a notice pinned to the back\nof his jacket which read as follows: \"Tolin\u00e9, to be conducted to\nEchuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter. Prepaid.\"]\n\nHere, it would seem, was another waif that Providence had cast in their\npath. They questioned him, and his answers were pertinent and clear. He\nhad been educated in the Wesleyan Methodist day-school at Melbourne,\nand was now going for a time to visit his parents, who were living\nwith the rest of their tribe in Lachlan. He had been in the train to\nwhich the accident had happened, and had, with childlike confidence,\ntroubled less about his fate than did those of older years. Going to a\nlittle distance, and laying himself on the grass, he had soon fallen\ninto the slumber from which our travelers had aroused him.\n\n[Illustration: Paganel and the others had now gathered round, and\nTolin\u00e9 had to answer many a question. He came out of his examination\nvery creditably.]\n\nPaganel and the others had now gathered round, and Tolin\u00e9 had to answer\nmany a question. He came out of his examination very creditably; the\nreverence with which he spoke of the Creator and of the Bible produced\na very favorable impression on the Scottish heads of the expedition,\nwhilst the fact that he had taken \"the first prize in geography\" was\nsufficient introduction to Monsieur Paganel, who forthwith tested his\nknowledge, greatly to his own satisfaction, and considerably to the\ncredit of his young pupil. The curiosity of his discoverers having been\nfully satisfied, Tolin\u00e9 was made welcome, and partook with the others\nof the general repast. Many were the plans and purposes concerning\nhim, and much wonder was expressed as to how they could speed him on\nhis way; but in the morning it was discovered that he had solved the\nproblem for himself, and a bouquet of fresh leaves and flowers, laid by\nthe side of Lady Helena's seat, was the only memento that Tolin\u00e9 had\nleft.\n\n[Sidenote: A GOLDEN CITY.]\n\nThe party were now approaching the district which, in the years 1851\nand 1852, was so much talked of throughout the civilized world,\nand attracted from all parts so many reckless adventurers and\nfortune-hunters. The line of the thirty-seventh parallel, on which they\nwere traveling, led them through the diggings and municipality of Mount\nAlexander, which was one of the most successful spots for the digger at\nthe commencement of the gold fever, in consequence of the comparatively\nlevel nature of the ground and the general richness of the soil, so\ndifferent from some other localities where only once in a while was\nsome enormous nugget to be found. As they drew near to the streets of\nthis hastily-built town, Ayrton and Mulready, who were in charge of the\ncart, were sent forward, whilst the others walked through the place to\ninspect what there might be of interest, as well as to ascertain what\nmight be learned concerning the object of their expedition.\n\nThus, in this strange gathering of all nationalities and creeds and\nprofessions, the regular inhabitants beheld a still more extraordinary\nsight than that every day afforded them: folks who to the refinement\nwhich education and civilization give added both the earnestness\nof the worker and the freshness and vigor of the pleasure-seeking\ntourist. In the streets, in connection with the strange sign-boards and\nannouncements, the novel erections and purposes to which some of them\nwere adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary for every one.\n\nStill more did he expatiate upon the thousand-and-one topics of\ninterest when they visited the bank building, which here is the\ncentre of more than one agency connected with this great gold-bearing\ndistrict. Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be seen\nspecimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold has\nbeen found, whether in combination with clay or other minerals, or--as\nit is sometimes, to the great joy of the finder, discovered--_pur\net simple_. Here also were models, diagrams, and even the tools\nthemselves, to illustrate the different methods by which the object\nof search was dug out, or washed, or crushed, or tested. Here also\nwas an almost unequaled collection of precious stones, gems of all\nsorts, making the gallery in which they were placed a real Golconda\nfor its wealth and attractions. Besides all this, here was the centre\nof the varied agencies by which the reports were brought in from the\ncompanies established for mining purposes, and also from each isolated\nworker, of the space purchased, the number of feet or yards dug, the\nore extracted, the comparative richness or poverty of the soil here,\nthere, and elsewhere, which in their summarized and aggregate form have\ngreatly helped to a correct knowledge of the comparative and absolute\ngold-bearing value of various spots. Then, in addition to the usual\noperations of a banking establishment, it was here that the ore was\nstored, from hence that it was sent, under government escort and with\ngovernment guarantee, subject to a fixed, though moderate, charge,\nso that the transport to Melbourne, which at first was a dangerous\nand expensive \"middle passage,\" was now as easily and inexpensively\naccomplished as is the transmission of freight from London to Paris.\n\n[Illustration: In the streets, in connection with the strange\nsign-boards and announcements, the novel erections and purposes to\nwhich some of them were adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary\nfor every one.]\n\nOver the whole of this establishment they were conducted by the most\ncourteous and obliging of officials, and the services thus rendered\ncharmed the Frenchman, who was none the less loquacious, and was in\ntruth able even to enlighten his guides.\n\n[Illustration: Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be\nseen specimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold\nhas been found.]\n\n[Sidenote: PLEASING PROGRESS.]\n\nBut his joy culminated when, after some time spent in the hotel, the\nparty left the town, and passed through the \"diggings,\" properly so\ncalled. It was difficult to persuade Paganel and Robert--who kept\ntogether--to come on, in order that they might not leave Ayrton and\nMulready too long in suspense. Now the Frenchman would see just the key\nthat he needed to understand a point not before clear to him; anon you\nmight see him as in the illustration, when he had picked up a pebble\nand was sure that it was in itself so interesting as a mineralogical\nspecimen that he must treasure it up for the Bank of France, so that\nhis own land might have at least one part of Australia. All this was\ndone with such a mingling of childish good-nature and scientific and\nnational pride that it was useless to do anything but laugh, and an\nirrepressible smile came over even the major's features. At length,\nhowever, by drawing him into a lecture, they succeeded in persuading\nhim to follow them; and, as they left the diggings, he told them the\nhistory of the prophecies, the discovery, and the spread of knowledge\nas to the rich auriferous deposits of this part of Australia. He\ncould give them facts and incidents and dates as to the ingress into\nMelbourne, and the exodus therefrom to the diggings, in the year 1852;\nhe told them how the energy and the love of order which characterize\nthe English-speaking peoples had reduced to system, method,\nsubordination, the chaotic surgings and restlessness which marked the\nfirst weeks and months of this new era; and he detailed, as though\nhe had studied the subject to the entire neglect of other matters,\nthe working of the system,--how the land was registered, what was the\nsum paid in the aggregate, how the taxes were collected, wherein the\nsystem had been found faulty. All this occupied much time, and, before\nhe had finished, the cart was in sight, in which Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant reseated themselves, and for the remainder of the day and the\nsucceeding night their progress was in the accustomed order.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nA WARNING.\n\n\nAt sunrise the travelers left the gold regions and crossed the\nfrontiers of the county of Talbot. Their line of travel now struck\nthe dusty roads of the county of Dalhousie. Half the journey was\naccomplished. In fifteen days more of travel equally rapid the little\nparty would reach the shores of Twofold Bay. Moreover, every one was in\ngood health. Paganel's assertions as to the salubrity of this climate\nwere verified. There was little or no moisture, and the heat was quite\nendurable. Neither men nor animals complained.\n\n[Illustration: Anon you might see him as in the illustration, when\nhe had picked up a pebble and was sure that it was in itself so\ninteresting as a mineralogical specimen that he must treasure it up for\nthe Bank of France.] [Sidenote: A PILLARED GROVE.]\n\nOnly one change had been made in the line of march since leaving\nCamden Bridge. The criminal disaster on the railway, when made known\nto Ayrton, had induced him to take precautions hitherto needless.\nThe horsemen were not to lose sight of the cart. During the hours of\nencampment one of them was always on guard. Morning and evening the\npriming of the fire-arms was renewed. It was certain that a band of\nmalefactors were scouring the country; and, although nothing gave cause\nfor immediate suspicion, still it was necessary to be ready for any\nemergency.", "In truth they had reason to act thus. An imprudence, or negligence\neven, might cost them dear. Glenarvan, moreover, was not alone in\ngiving heed to this state of affairs. In the isolated towns and\nstations the inhabitants and squatters took precautions against any\nattack or surprise. The houses were closed at nightfall. The dogs were\nlet loose within the palisades, and barked at the slightest alarm.\nThere was not a shepherd, collecting his numerous flocks on horseback\nfor the evening return, who did not carry a carbine suspended from the\npommel of his saddle. The news of the crime committed at Camden Bridge\nwas the reason for this excessive caution, and many a colonist who had\nformerly slept with open doors and windows now carefully locked his\nhouse at twilight.\n\nAfter awhile, the cart entered a grove of giant trees, the finest\nthey had hitherto seen. There was a cry of admiration at sight of the\neucalyptuses, two hundred feet high, whose spongy bark was five inches\nin thickness. The trunks measured twenty feet in circumference, and\nwere furrowed by streams of odorous sap. Not a branch, not a twig, not\na wanton shoot, not even a knot, disfigured their perfect symmetry.\nThey could not have issued smoother from the hand of the turner. They\nwere like so many columns exactly mated, and could be counted by\nhundreds, spreading at a vast height into capitals of finely-shaped\nbranches adorned with vertical leaves, from which hung solitary\nflowers, whose calices were like inverted urns.\n\nUnder this evergreen canopy the air circulated freely. A continual\nventilation absorbed the moisture of the earth, and horses, herds of\ncattle, and carts could easily pass between these trees, which were\nwidely separated and arranged in straight rows. It was neither a\nwood with thickets crowded and obstructed by brambles, nor a virgin\nforest barricaded with fallen trunks and entangled with inextricable\nparasites, where only axe and fire can clear a way for the pioneers.\nA carpet of herbage below, and a sheet of verdure above; long vistas\nof noble pillars; little shade or coolness; a peculiar light, like\nthe rays that sift through a delicate tissue; shadows sharply defined\nupon the ground: all this constituted a strange sight. The forests of\nOceanica are entirely different from those of the New World, and the\neucalyptus--the \"tara\" of the aborigines--is the most perfect tree of\nthe Australian flora.\n\nThe shade is not dense, nor the darkness profound, beneath these domes\nof verdure, owing to a strange peculiarity in the arrangement of the\nleaves of the eucalyptus. Not one presents its face to the sun, but\nonly its sharp edge. The eye sees nothing but profiles in this singular\nfoliage. Thus the rays of the sun glide to the earth as if they had\npassed between the slats of a window-blind.\n\nEvery one observed this and seemed surprised. Why this particular\narrangement? This question was naturally addressed to Paganel, who\nreplied like a man who is never at fault.\n\n\"What astonishes me,\" said he, \"is not the freak of nature, for she\nknows what she does; but botanists do not always know what they say.\nNature was not mistaken in giving to these trees this singular foliage;\nbut men are wrong in calling them eucalyptuses.\"\n\n\"What does the word mean?\" asked Mary Grant.\n\n\"It comes from the Greek words [Greek: eu kalypt\u00f4], signifying _I cover\nwell_. But you all see that the eucalyptus covers badly.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SILENT MARCH.]\n\n\"Just so, my dear Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and now tell us why the\nleaves grow thus.\"\n\n\"In this country, where the air is dry,\" said Paganel, \"where rains\nare rare and the soil is parched, the trees need neither wind nor\nsun. Hence these narrow leaves seek to defend themselves against the\nelements and preserve themselves from too great an evaporation. They\ntherefore present their edges, and not their faces, to the action of\nthe solar rays. There is nothing more intelligent than a leaf.\"\n\n\"Nor more selfish,\" remarked the major. \"They thought only of\nthemselves, and not at all of travelers.\"\n\nThe entire party was inclined to be of MacNabb's opinion, except\nPaganel, who, as he wiped his face, congratulated himself upon\ntraveling beneath these shadowless trees. However, this arrangement of\nfoliage was to be regretted; for the journey through these forests is\nfrequently very long and painful, since nothing protects the traveler\nfrom the heat of the sun.\n\nAll day long our travelers pursued their way under these interminable\narches. They met neither quadruped nor human being. A few cockatoos\ninhabited the tops of the trees; but at that height they could scarcely\nbe distinguished, and their chattering was an almost inaudible murmur.\nSometimes a flock of parrots would shoot across a distant vista,\nillumining it with a rapid flash of variegated light. But generally a\ndeep silence reigned in this vast temple of verdure, and the measured\ntread of the horses, a few words exchanged now and then in desultory\nconversation, the creaking of the cart-wheels, and from time to time a\ncry from Ayrton as he urged on his sluggish team, were the only sounds\nthat disturbed this vast solitude.\n\n[Illustration: They were like so many columns exactly mated, and could\nbe counted by hundreds.]\n\nAt evening they encamped at the foot of some trees that bore the marks\nof a recent fire. They formed tall chimneys, as it were, for the flames\nhad hollowed them out internally throughout their entire length.\nHaving only this shell of bark remaining, they no longer suffered\nseverely from this treatment. However, this lamentable habit of the\nsquatters and natives will finally destroy these magnificent trees, and\nthey will disappear like the cedars of Lebanon, so many centuries old,\nconsumed by the careless fires of wandering encampments.\n\n[Illustration: At evening they encamped at the foot of some trees that\nbore the marks of a recent fire. They formed tall chimneys, as it were,\nfor the flames had hollowed them out internally throughout their entire\nlength.]\n\nOlbinett, according to Paganel's advice, kindled a fire in one of these\ntubular trunks. He obtained a draught at once, and the smoke soon\ndisappeared in the dark mass of foliage. The necessary precautions were\ntaken for the night, and Ayrton, Mulready, Wilson, and Captain Mangles\nwatched by turns till sunrise.\n\nDuring all the next day the interminable forest presented its long,\nmonotonous avenues, till it seemed as if it would never end. Towards\nevening, however, the rows of trees became thinner; and a few miles\nfarther on, upon a small plain, appeared a collection of regularly\nbuilt houses.\n\n\"Seymour!\" cried Paganel. \"This is the last place we shall meet with\nbefore leaving the province of Victoria.\"\n\n\"Is it an important town?\" inquired Lady Helena.\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, \"it is a simple parish that would like to become a\nmunicipality.\"\n\n\"Shall we find a comfortable hotel?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I hope so,\" answered the geographer.\n\n\"Well, then, let us go into the town; for the ladies will not be sorry,\nI imagine, to rest here one night.\"\n\n\"My dear Edward,\" replied Lady Helena, \"Mary and I accept; but on the\ncondition that it shall cause no trouble or delay.\"\n\n\"None at all,\" said Lord Glenarvan. \"Moreover, our oxen are fatigued.\nTo-morrow we will start at break of day.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A TALK AFTER SUPPER.]\n\nIt was now nine o'clock. The moon was approaching the horizon, and her\nrays were dimmed by the gathering mist. The darkness was increasing.\nThe whole party, accordingly, entered the broad street of Seymour under\nthe guidance of Paganel, who always seemed to be perfectly acquainted\nwith what he had never seen. But his instinct directed him, and he went\nstraight to Campbell's North British Hotel. Horses and oxen were taken\nto the stable, the cart was put under the shed, and the travelers were\nconducted to quite comfortable apartments.\n\nAt ten o'clock the guests took their seats at a table, over which\nOlbinett had cast his experienced eye. Paganel had just explored the\ntown, in company with Robert, and now related his nocturnal impressions\nin a very laconic style. He had seen absolutely nothing.\n\nHowever, a man less absent-minded would have observed a certain\nexcitement in the streets of Seymour. Groups were formed here and\nthere, which gradually increased. People talked at the doors of the\nhouses, and questioned each other with an air of anxiety. Various daily\npapers were read aloud, commented upon, and discussed. These signs,\none might suppose, could not have escaped the most careless observer;\nPaganel, however, had suspected nothing.\n\nThe major, on the contrary, without even leaving the hotel, had\nascertained the fears that were agitating the little community. Ten\nminutes' conversation with the loquacious landlord had informed him;\nbut he did not utter a word. Not until supper was over, and Lady\nHelena, Mary, and Robert had retired to their chambers, did the major\nsay to his companions:\n\n\"They have traced the authors of the crime committed at Camden Bridge.\"\n\n\"Have they been arrested?\" asked Ayrton, quickly.\n\n\"No,\" replied MacNabb, without seeming to notice the eagerness of the\nquartermaster.\n\n\"So much the worse,\" added Ayrton.\n\n\"Well,\" inquired Glenarvan, \"to whom do they attribute the crime?\"\n\n\"Read,\" said the major, handing to Glenarvan a copy of the _Australian\nand New Zealand Gazette_, \"and you will see that the police-officer was\nnot mistaken.\"\n\nGlenarvan read aloud the following passage:", "Glenarvan read aloud the following passage:\n\n\"Sydney, Jan. 2, 1865.--It will be remembered that on the night of\nDecember 29 an accident took place at Camden Bridge, five miles from\nCastlemaine Station, on the Melbourne and Sandhurst Railway, by which\nthe night express was precipitated at full speed into the Lutton River.\nNumerous thefts committed after the accident, and the corpse of the\nguard found half a mile above, prove that it was the result of a crime;\nand, in accordance with the verdict at the inquest, this crime is to\nbe attributed to a band of convicts who escaped, six months ago, from\nthe Perth penitentiary, in Western Australia, as they were about to\nbe transferred to Norfolk Island. These convicts are twenty-nine in\nnumber, and are commanded by a certain Ben Joyce, a dangerous criminal,\nwho arrived in Australia several months ago in some way, and upon whom\njustice has not yet succeeded in laying hands. The inhabitants of the\ncities, and the colonists and squatters of the stations, are warned\nto be on their guard, and requested to send to the undersigned any\ninformation which may assist his investigations.\n\n                              \"J.

MITCHELL, Surveyor-General.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Glenarvan had finished reading this article, MacNabb turned to the\ngeographer and said:\n\n\"You see, Paganel, that there may yet be convicts in Australia.\"\n\n\"Runaways there may be, of course,\" replied Paganel, \"but not those\nwho have been transported and regularly received. These people have no\nright to be here.\"\n\n\"Well, at any rate they are here,\" continued Glenarvan; \"but I do not\nsuppose that their presence need cause us to change our plans or delay\nour journey. What do you think, captain?\"\n\n[Sidenote: LOOKING AT BOTH SIDES.]\n\nCaptain Mangles did not answer immediately. He hesitated between the\ngrief that the abandonment of the search would cause the two children,\nand the fear of compromising the safety of the party.\n\n\"If Lady Glenarvan and Miss Grant were not with us,\" said he, \"I should\ncare very little for this band of wretches.\"\n\nGlenarvan understood him, and added:\n\n\"Of course it is not advisable to give up our undertaking; but perhaps\nit would be prudent for the sake of the ladies to join the Duncan at\nMelbourne, and continue our search for Captain Grant towards the east.\nWhat do you think, MacNabb?\"\n\n\"Before replying,\" said the major, \"I should like to hear Ayrton's\nopinion.\"\n\nThe quartermaster, thus addressed, looked at Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think,\" said he, \"that, as we are two hundred miles from Melbourne,\nthe danger, if there is any, is as great on the southern as on the\neastern road. Both are little frequented, and one is as good as the\nother. Moreover, I do not think that thirty malefactors can intimidate\neight well-armed and resolute men. Therefore, in the absence of better\nadvice, I should go on.\"\n\n\"Well said,\" replied Paganel. \"By continuing our course we shall cross\nCaptain Grant's track, while by returning to the south we should go\ndirectly away from it. I agree with you, therefore, and shall give\nmyself no uneasiness about the runaway convicts.\"\n\nThus the determination to make no change in the programme was\nunanimously approved of.\n\n\"One more remark, my lord,\" said Ayrton, as they were about to separate.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Would it not be advisable to send an order to the Duncan to sail to\nthe coast?\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Captain Mangles. \"It will be time enough to send the order\nwhen we arrive at Twofold Bay. If any unforeseen event should compel\nus to return to Melbourne, we might be sorry not to find the Duncan\nthere. Moreover, her injuries cannot yet have been repaired. I think,\ntherefore, that it would be better to wait.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Ayrton, without further remark.\n\nThe next day the little party, armed and ready for any emergency, left\nSeymour, and half an hour after re-entered the forest of eucalyptuses,\nwhich appeared again towards the east. Glenarvan would have preferred\nto travel in the open country, for a plain is less favorable to sudden\nattacks and ambuscades than a thick wood. But they had no alternative;\nand the cart kept on all day between the tall, monotonous trees, and at\nevening encamped on the borders of the district of Murray.\n\nThey were now setting foot on one of the least frequented portions of\nthe Australian continent, a vast uninhabited region stretching away to\nthe Australian Alps. At some future day its forests will be leveled,\nand the home of the colonist will stand where now all is desolation;\nbut at present it is a desert. In this region is situated the so-styled\n\"reserve for the blacks.\" On these remote plains various spots have\nbeen set apart, where the aboriginal race can enjoy to the full the\nprivilege of gradually becoming extinct. Though the white man is at\nperfect liberty to invade this \"reserved\" territory, yet the black may\ncall it his own.\n\nPaganel, who was in his element wherever statistics or history was\nconcerned, went into full details respecting the native races. He gave\na long account of the cruelties to which these unfortunate beings\nhad been subjected at the hands of the early colonists, and showed\nhow little had been done by the interference of the government. As\na striking instance of the manner in which the aborigines melt away\nbefore the advance of civilization, he cited the case of Tasmania,\nwhich at the beginning of this century had five thousand native\ninhabitants, but in 1863 had only seven.\n\n[Sidenote: STUDIES IN ANTHROPOLOGY.]\n\n\"Fifty years ago,\" said he, \"we should have met in our course many\na tribe of natives; whereas thus far we have not seen even one. A\ncentury hence, the black race will have utterly disappeared from this\ncontinent.\"\n\nAt that moment Robert, halting in front of a group of eucalyptuses,\ncried out:\n\n\"A monkey! there is a monkey!\"\n\nThe cart was instantly stopped, and, looking in the direction\nindicated by the boy, our travellers saw a huge black form moving with\nastonishing agility from branch to branch, until it was lost from view\nin the depths of the grove.\n\n\"What sort of a monkey is that?\" asked MacNabb.\n\n\"That monkey,\" answered Paganel, \"is a full-blooded Australian.\"\n\nJust then were heard sounds of voices at some little distance; the oxen\nwere put in motion, and after proceeding a few hundred paces the party\ncame suddenly upon an encampment of aborigines, consisting of some\nten or twelve tents, made of strips of bark arranged in the manner of\ntiles, and giving shelter to their wretched inhabitants on only one\nside. Of these miserable beings there were about thirty, men, women,\nand children, dressed in ragged kangaroo-skins. Their first movement\nwas one of flight; but a few words from Ayrton restored confidence, and\nthey slowly approached the party of Europeans.\n\nThe major jocularly insisted that Robert was correct in saying that\nhe had seen a monkey; but Lady Helena declined to accept his views,\nand, getting out of the cart, made friendly advances to these degraded\nbeings, who seemed to look upon her as a divinity. Reassured by her\ngentle manner, they surrounded the travelers, and began to cast wishful\nglances at the provisions which the cart contained. Glenarvan, at the\nrequest of his wife, distributed a quantity of food among the hungry\ngroup.\n\n[Illustration: Of these miserable beings there were about thirty, men,\nwomen, and children, dressed in ragged kangaroo-skins.]\n\nAfter this had been dispatched, our friends were favored by their new\nacquaintances with a sham fight, which lasted about ten minutes, the\nwomen urging on the combatants and pretending to mutilate those who\nfell in the fray. Suddenly the excited crowd dropped their arms, and\na profound silence succeeded to the din of war. A flight of cockatoos\nhad made its appearance in the neighboring trees; and the opportunity\nto display their proficiency in the use of the boomerang was at once\nimproved by the Australians. The skill manifested in the construction\nand use of this instrument served Lady Helena as a strong argument\nagainst the monkey theory, though the major pretended that he was not\nyet convinced.\n\n[Illustration: A sham fight, which lasted about ten minutes, the women\nurging on the combatants and pretending to mutilate those who fell in\nthe fray.]\n\nLord Glenarvan was now about to give the order to advance, when a\nnative came running up with the news that he had discovered half\na dozen cassowaries. The chase that followed, with the ingenious\ndisguise assumed by the hunter, and the marvelous fidelity with which\nhe imitated the movements and cries of the bird, was witnessed with\ninterest by the travelers. Lady Helena adduced the skill displayed as\na still further argument against the major's theory; but the obstinate\nMacNabb declined to recede from his position, citing to his antagonist\nthe statement of the negroes concerning the orang-outangs,--that they\nare negroes like themselves, only that they are too cunning to talk,\nfor fear of being made to work.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nWEALTH IN THE WILDERNESS.\n\n\n[Sidenote: A PIANO IN THE DESERT.]\n\nAfter a peaceful night, the travelers, at seven o'clock in the morning,\nresumed their journey eastward over the plains. Twice they crossed the\ntracks of squatters, leading towards the north; and then the different\nhoof-prints would have been confounded if Glenarvan's horse had not\nleft upon the dust the Black Point mark, distinguishable by its three\ntrefoils.\n\nSometimes the plain was furrowed with winding creeks, bordered by\nbox-wood, which took their source on the slopes of the Buffalo Range,\na chain of mountains whose picturesque outlines stretched along the\nhorizon, and which the party resolved to reach that evening. Ayrton\nurged on his oxen, and, after a journey of thirty-five miles, they\nreached the place. The tent was pitched beneath a great tree. Night had\ncome, and supper was quickly dispatched; all thought more of sleeping\nthan of eating, after the fatigues of the day.", "Paganel, to whom fell the first watch, did not lie down, but, rifle on\nshoulder, guarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the\nbetter resist sleep. In spite of the absence of the moon, the night was\nalmost bright with the splendor of the southern constellations; and the\ngeographer amused himself in reading the great book of the firmament,\nwhich is always open. The silence of sleeping nature was broken only\nby the sound of the horses' chains as they rattled against their feet.\nPaganel was becoming fully absorbed in his astronomical meditations,\nand occupying himself more with the things of heaven than those of\nearth, when a distant sound startled him from his reverie.\n\nHe listened attentively, and, to his great astonishment, thought he\ndistinguished the tones of a piano. A few boldly-struck chords wafted\nto his ears their harmonious vibrations. He could not be mistaken.\n\n\"A piano in the desert!\" said he to himself. \"It cannot be!\"\n\nIt was indeed very surprising, and Paganel began to think that some\nstrange Australian bird was imitating the sound of the instrument.\n\n[Sidenote: A TWOFOLD SURPRISE.]\n\nBut at that moment a voice, harmoniously pitched, was heard. The\npianist was accompanied by a vocalist. The geographer listened\nincredulously, but in a few moments was forced to recognize the\nsublime air that struck upon his ear. It was \"_Il mio tesoro tanto_\"\nfrom Don Juan.\n\n[Illustration: Paganel did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder,\nguarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better\nresist sleep.]\n\n\"Parbleu!\" thought the geographer, \"however strange the Australian\nbirds may be, or even though the parrots were the most musical in the\nworld, they could not sing Mozart.\"\n\nHe listened to the end of this grand inspiration of the master. The\neffect of this sweet melody, in the stillness of the starlit night,\nwas indescribable. He remained a long time under the influences of its\nenchantment. At last the voice ceased, and all was silent.\n\nWhen Wilson came to relieve the geographer, he found him wrapt in a\nprofound reverie. Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving\nhis account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into\nthe tent.\n\nIn the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings.\nGlenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along\nthe edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they\ndisappeared among the trees, barking loudly.\n\n\"There must be a station in this desert,\" said Glenarvan, \"and hunters,\nsince those are hunting-dogs.\"\n\nPaganel was just about to relate his experiences of the past night,\nwhen two men appeared, in hunting costume, mounted on fine horses. They\nnaturally stopped at sight of the little party, encamped in gypsy-like\nfashion, and seemed to be wondering what the presence of armed men in\nthis place meant, when they perceived the ladies, who were alighting\nfrom the cart.\n\nThey immediately dismounted, and advanced towards them, hat in hand.\nGlenarvan went to meet them, and introduced himself and party, giving\nthe name and rank of each member. The young men bowed, and one of them,\nthe elder, said:\n\n\"My lord, will your ladies, your companions, and yourself do us the\nhonor to accompany us to our house?\"\n\n\"May I ask, gentlemen, whom I have the honor of addressing?\" inquired\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"Michael and Alexander Patterson, proprietors of Hottam Station. You\nare already on the grounds of the establishment, and have but a quarter\nof a mile to go.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied Glenarvan, \"I should be unwilling to slight a\nhospitality so graciously offered----\"\n\n\"My lord,\" interrupted Michael Patterson, \"by accepting you will confer\na favor upon two poor colonists, who will be only too happy to extend\nto you the honors of the desert.\"\n\nGlenarvan bowed in token of assent.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Paganel, addressing Michael Patterson, \"should I be too\ninquisitive were I to ask if it was you who sang that divine air of\nMozart last night?\"\n\n\"It was I, sir,\" replied the gentleman; \"and my brother accompanied me.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" continued Paganel, extending his hand, \"accept the sincere\ncompliments of a Frenchman, who is an ardent admirer of Mozart's music.\"\n\nThe young man modestly returned the geographer's greeting, and then\npointed towards the right to the road they were to take. The horses had\nbeen confided to the care of Ayrton and the sailors, and the travelers\nat once betook themselves on foot to Hottam Station, under the guidance\nof the two young men.\n\nIt was a magnificent establishment, characterized by the perfect order\nof an English park. Immense meadows, inclosed by fences, extended as\nfar as the eye could reach. Here grazed thousands of oxen and sheep.\nNumerous shepherds and still more numerous dogs tended this vast herd,\nwhile with the bellowing and bleating mingled the baying of mastiffs\nand the sharp crack of stock-whips.\n\n[Sidenote: ARTIFICIAL SELECTION.]\n\nTo the east the prospect was broken by a border of gum-trees, beyond\nwhich rose the imposing peak of Mount Hottam, seven thousand five\nhundred feet high. Long avenues of tall trees stretched in all\ndirections, while here and there stood dense clumps of grass-trees,\nshrubby plants about ten feet high, resembling the dwarf palm, with a\nthick foliage of long narrow leaves. The air was laden with the perfume\nof laurels, whose clusters of white flowers in full bloom exhaled the\nmost delicate fragrance.\n\nWith the charming groups of native trees were mingled those\ntransplanted from European climes. The peach, the pear, the apple,\nthe fig, the orange, and even the oak were hailed with delight by the\ntravelers, who, if they were not astonished at walking in the shade of\nthe trees of their country, wondered, at least, at the sight of the\nbirds that fluttered among the branches, the satin-birds with their\nsilky plumage, and the canaries, clad in golden and black velvet.\n\nHere, for the first time, they saw the menure, or lyre-bird, whose tail\nhas the form of the graceful instrument of Orpheus. As the bird fled\naway among the arborescent ferns, its tail striking the branches, they\nalmost expected to hear those harmonious chords that helped Amphion to\nrebuild the walls of Thebes.\n\nLord Glenarvan was not satisfied with merely admiring the fairy\nwonders of this oasis of the Australian desert. He listened with\nprofound interest to the young men's story. In England, in the heart\nof civilization, a new-comer would have first informed his host\nwhence he came and whither he was going; but here, by a nice shade\nof distinction, Michael and Sandy Patterson thought they should\nmake themselves known to the travelers to whom they offered their\nhospitalities, and briefly told their story.\n\n[Illustration: Here, for the first time, they saw the menure, or\nlyre-bird, whose tail has the form of the graceful instrument of\nOrpheus.]\n\n[Sidenote: NATURE AND ART.]\n\nIt was like that of all intelligent and active young Englishmen,\nwho do not believe that the possession of riches absolves from the\nresponsibility to labor for the welfare of others. Michael and\nAlexander Patterson were the sons of a London banker. When they were\ntwenty years old, their father had said: \"Here is money, my sons. Go\nto some distant land, found there a useful establishment, and acquire\nin labor the knowledge of life. If you succeed, so much the better; if\nyou fail, it matters little. We shall not regret the money that will\nhave enabled you to become men.\" They obeyed; they chose the province\nof Victoria as the place to sow the paternal bank-notes, and had no\nreason to repent. At the end of three years their establishment had\nattained its present prosperity.\n\nThey had just finished the brief account of their career, when the\ndwelling came in sight at the end of a fine avenue of trees. It was a\ncharming house of wood and brick, surrounded by clusters of plants, and\nhad the elegant form of a Swiss cottage, while a veranda, from which\nhung Chinese lanterns, encircled it like a Roman impluvium. The windows\nwere shaded by brilliant-colored awnings, which at a distance looked\nalmost like masses of flowers. Nothing could be prettier, cozier, or\npleasanter to the sight. On the lawn and among the shrubbery round\nabout stood bronze candelabra, supporting elegant lamps with glass\nglobes, which at nightfall illumined the whole garden with a beauteous\nlight.\n\nNo farm-hands, stables, or outhouses were to be seen,--nothing that\nindicated scenes of toil. The dwellings of the workmen--a regular\nvillage, consisting of some twenty cottages--were a quarter of a mile\ndistant, in the heart of a little valley. Telegraph-wires secured\nimmediate communication between the village and the house of the\nproprietors, which, far from all tumult, was in truth \"a thing of\nbeauty.\"\n\nThe avenue was soon passed. A little iron bridge, of great elegance,\ncrossing a murmuring stream, gave access to the private grounds. A\ncourteous attendant advanced to meet the travelers; the doors of\nthe house were opened, and the guests of Hottam Station entered the\nsumptuous dwelling.", "All the luxuries of refined and civilized life seemed to be present.\nInto the vestibule, which was adorned with decorative subjects,\nillustrating the turf or the chase, opened a spacious parlor, lighted\nwith five windows. A piano, covered with classic and modern music;\neasels, upon which were half-finished paintings; marble statues,\nmounted on tasteful pedestals; on the walls, a few pictures by Flemish\nmasters; rich carpets, soft to the feet as grassy meadows; panels of\ntapestry, descriptive of pleasing mythological episodes; an antique\nchandelier, costly chinaware, delicate vases, and a great variety\nof articles of _virt\u00f9_, indicated a high appreciation of beauty and\ncomfort. Everything that could please, everything that could relieve\nthe tedium of a voluntary exile, everything that could remind one of a\nluxurious European home, was to be found in this fairy abode. It would\nhave been easy to imagine oneself in some princely castle of England,\nFrance, or Germany.\n\nThe five windows admitted, through delicate curtains, a light tempered\nand softened by the shadows of the veranda. Lady Helena looked out,\nand was astonished. The house, upon this side, commanded the view of a\nbroad valley, which extended to the eastern mountains. The alternation\nof meadow and woodland, broken here and there by vast clearings, the\ngraceful sweep of the hill-sides, and the outlines of the entire\nlandscape, formed a picture beyond the power of description. This vast\npanorama, intersected by broad bands of light and shade, changed every\nhour with the progress of the sun.\n\nIn the mean time, in accordance with the hosts' orders, breakfast\nhad been prepared by the steward of the station, and in less than a\nquarter of an hour the travelers were seated at a bountiful table. The\nquality of the viands and the wines was unexceptionable; but what was\nespecially gratifying, in the midst of these refinements of wealth, was\nthe evident pleasure experienced by the young settlers in dispensing to\nstrangers, beneath their own roof, this magnificent hospitality.\n\n[Sidenote: AUSTRALIANS, NATIVE AND IMPORTED.]\n\nThe young gentlemen were soon made acquainted with the object of the\nexpedition, and took a lively interest in Glenarvan's search, giving\nalso great encouragement to the captain's children.\n\n\"Harry Grant,\" said Michael, \"has evidently fallen into the hands of\nthe natives, since he has not appeared in the settlements on the coast.\nHe knew his position exactly, as the document proves, and, as he has\nnot reached any English colony, he must have been made prisoner by the\nnatives as soon as he landed.\"\n\n\"That is precisely what happened to his quartermaster, Ayrton,\" replied\nCaptain Mangles.\n\n\"But, gentlemen,\" inquired Lady Helena, \"have you never heard of the\nshipwreck of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Never, madam,\" said Michael.\n\n\"And what treatment do you think Captain Grant would experience as a\nprisoner among the Australians?\"\n\n\"The Australians are not cruel, madam,\" replied the young settler:\n\"Miss Grant may reassure herself on this point. There are many\ninstances of their kindness; and some Europeans have lived a long time\namong them, without having any reason to complain of brutality.\" These\nwords corroborated the information previously given by Paganel and\nAyrton.\n\nWhen the ladies had left the table, the conversation turned upon\nconvicts. The settlers had heard of the accident at Camden Bridge,\nbut the band of runaways gave no uneasiness, they would not dare to\nattack a station that was guarded by more than a hundred men. They were\nconfident, too, that they would not venture into the deserted regions\nof the Murray, nor into the colonies of New South Wales, where the\nroads are well protected.\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY'S SPORT.]\n\nGlenarvan could not decline the invitation of his amiable hosts to\nspend the entire day at Hottam Station. The delay thus occasioned\ncould be turned to good account: the horses and oxen would be\ngreatly benefited by their rest in the comfortable stables of the\nestablishment. It was, therefore, decided to remain, and the two young\nmen submitted to their guests a programme for the day's sports, which\nwas adopted with alacrity.\n\n[Illustration: It was a charming house of wood and brick, surrounded by\nclusters of plants, and had the elegant form of a Swiss cottage.]\n\nAt noon, seven fine hunters pawed the ground at the gate of the\nhouse. For the ladies was provided an elegant coach, and the long\nreins enabled their driver to show his skill in manoeuvring the\n\"four-in-hand.\" The horsemen, accompanied by outriders, and well armed,\ngalloped beside the carriage, while the pack of hounds bayed joyously\nin the coppices.\n\nFor four hours the cavalcade traversed the paths and avenues of these\nspacious grounds. As for game, an army of bushmen could not have\nstarted up a greater number of animals. Young Robert, who kept close to\nthe major's side, accomplished wonders. The intrepid boy, in spite of\nhis sister's injunctions, was always ahead, and the first to fire. But\nCaptain Mangles had promised to watch over him, a fact which tended not\na little to allay Miss Grant's apprehension for her brother's safety.\n\nOf all the sports of the day the most interesting was unquestionably\na kangaroo hunt. About four o'clock the dogs started a troop of these\ncurious animals. The little ones took refuge in their mothers' pouches,\nand the whole drove rushed away in single file. Nothing can be more\nastonishing than the enormous bounds of the kangaroo, whose hind legs\nare twice as long as its fore ones, and bend like a spring. At the head\nof the drove was a male five feet high,--\"an old man,\" in the language\nof the bushmen.\n\nFor four or five miles the chase was briskly continued. The kangaroos\ndid not slacken their pace; and the dogs, who feared, with good reason,\nthe powerful blows of their formidable paws, did not venture to\napproach them. But at last the drove stopped in exhaustion, and \"the\nold man\" braced himself against the trunk of a tree, ready to fight\nfor his life. One of the pointers, carried on by the impetus of his\ncourse, rolled within reach of him. A moment after, the unfortunate\ndog was tossed into the air, and fell back lifeless. The entire pack,\ndeterred by the fate of their comrade, kept at a respectful distance.\nIt became necessary to dispatch the kangaroo with the rifle, and\nnothing but bullets could bring down the gigantic quadruped.\n\nAt this juncture Robert narrowly escaped being the victim of his\nrashness. In order to make sure of his aim, he approached so near the\nkangaroo that the animal made a spring at him. Robert fell. A cry of\nalarm resounded. Mary Grant, speechless with apprehension, stretched\nher hands towards her brother. No one dared to fire, for fear of\nhitting the boy.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles, with his hunting-knife open, rushed upon the\nkangaroo, at the risk of his life, and stabbed it to the heart. The\nbeast fell dead, and Robert rose unharmed. An instant after, he was in\nthe arms of his sister.\n\n\"Thanks, Captain Mangles! thanks!\" said Mary, extending her hand to the\nyoung captain.\n\n\"I promised to take care of him,\" replied the captain, as he took the\ntrembling hand of the young girl.\n\nThis adventure ended the hunt. The troop of kangaroos had scattered\nafter the death of their leader, whose carcass was brought to the house.\n\nIt was now six o'clock, and dinner was in readiness for the hunters;\ncomprising, among other dishes, a soup of kangaroo's tail, prepared in\nthe native style.\n\nAfter a dessert of ices and sherbet, the party repaired to the parlor,\nwhere the evening was devoted to music. Lady Helena, who was a good\npianiste, presided at the instrument, while Michael and Alexander\nPatterson sang with great taste selections from the latest compositions\nof the modern musical masters.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH DEPARTURE.]\n\nAt eleven o'clock tea was served in true English style. Paganel\nhaving desired to taste the Australian tea, a liquid, black as ink,\nwas brought to him. It consisted of a quart of water, in which half\na pound of tea had been boiled four hours. Paganel, with a wry face,\npronounced it excellent. At midnight the guests were conducted to cool\nand comfortable chambers, where they renewed in dreams the pleasures of\nthe day.\n\nThe next morning, at sunrise, they took leave of the two young\nsettlers, with many thanks, and with warmly-expressed hopes to see them\nat Malcolm Castle at no very distant day. The cart then started, and in\na few minutes, as the road wound around the foot of Mount Hottam, the\nhospitable habitation disappeared, like a passing vision, from the eyes\nof the travelers. For five miles farther they traversed the grounds\nof the station, and not till nine o'clock did the little party pass\nthe last palisade and enter upon the almost unknown districts of the\ncountry before them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nSUSPICIOUS OCCURRENCES.\n\n\nA mighty barrier crossed the road on the southeast. It was the chain\nof the Australian Alps, which extend in capricious windings fifteen\nhundred miles, and are capped with clouds four thousand feet aloft.\n\n[Sidenote: ASCENDING THE MOUNTAINS.]\n\nThe sky was dull and lowering, and the rays of the sun struggled\nthrough dense masses of mist. The temperature was, therefore,\nendurable; but the journey was difficult on account of the irregularity\nof the surface. The unevenness of the plain constantly increased,\nand here and there rose mounds, covered with young green gum-trees.\nFarther on, these excrescences formed the first slopes of the great\nAlps. The ascent was very laborious, as was shown by the efforts of the\noxen, whose yokes cracked under the tension of the heavy vehicle. The\nanimals panted heavily, and the muscles of their hams were strained\nalmost to breaking. The axles threatened to give way under the sudden\njolts that Ayrton, with all his skill, could not prevent. The ladies,\nhowever, lost none of their accustomed cheerfulness.", "[Illustration: Of all the sports of the day the most interesting was\nunquestionably a kangaroo hunt.]\n\nCaptain Mangles and the two sailors rode a few hundred paces in\nadvance, to choose practicable passes. It was a difficult and often a\nperilous task. Several times Wilson was forced to make a way with his\nhatchet through the midst of dense thickets. Their course deviated in\nmany windings, which impassable obstacles, lofty blocks of granite,\ndeep ravines, and treacherous swamps compelled them to make. At evening\nthey encamped at the foot of the Alps, on the banks of a small stream\nthat flowed along the edge of a plain covered with tall shrubbery,\nwhose bright-red foliage enlivened the banks.\n\n\"We shall have difficulty in passing here,\" said Glenarvan, as he gazed\nat the chain of mountains, whose outlines were already growing dim in\nthe twilight. \"Alps! that is a name suggestive of arduous climbing.\"\n\n\"You will change your opinion, my dear Glenarvan,\" replied Paganel.\n\"You must not think you are in Switzerland.\"\n\n\"Then these Australian Alps----?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"Are miniature mountains,\" continued Paganel. \"You will cross them\nwithout noticing it.\"\n\nThe next day, in spite of the assurances of the confident geographer,\nthe little party found great difficulty in crossing the mountains. They\nwere forced to advance at a venture, and descend into deep and narrow\ngorges that, for aught they knew, might end in a wall of rock. Ayrton\nwould doubtless have been eventually nonplused had they not, after an\nhour's climbing, caught sight of a tavern on one of the paths of the\nmountain.\n\n\"Well!\" said Paganel, as they reached the hostelry, \"the proprietor of\nthis inn cannot make a great fortune in such a place. Of what use can\nhe be?\"\n\n\"To give us the information we need for our journey,\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Let us go in.\"\n\nGlenarvan, followed by Ayrton, entered the tavern. The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen.\n\nHe replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course.\nGlenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\"\n\n\"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\"\n\n\"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\"\n\n\"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton.\n\nGlenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.]\n\nBut it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance.\n\nWhether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death.\n\n\"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\"\n\nMulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows.\n\nThe next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees. It was necessary to wait for the end of this avalanche, for fear\nof being stoned to death, and it was an hour before the party regained\nthe steep path, still slippery with icy incrustations. At evening the\ncart, considerably shattered, but still firm on its wooden wheels,\ndescended the last slopes of the Alps, between tall solitary pines, and\nreached the plains of Gippsland.\n\n[Illustration: Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's\nhand, were precipitated from the angry clouds.]\n\n[Sidenote: DIVIDED COUNSELS.]\n\nAll were impatient to gain their destination, the Pacific Ocean,\nwhere the Britannia had been wrecked. There only could traces of the\nshipwrecked seamen be found, and not in these desert regions. Ayrton\nurged Lord Glenarvan to send an order to the Duncan to repair to the\ncoast, that he might have at his disposal all the aid possible in his\nsearch. In his opinion they ought to take advantage of the Lucknow\nroad, which would lead them to Melbourne. Afterwards this might be\ndifficult, for highways leading directly to the capital would be\nabsolutely wanting.\n\nThis advice of the quartermaster seemed reasonable. Paganel seconded\nit. He thought, too, that the yacht would be very useful under the\npresent circumstances, and added that they could no longer communicate\nwith Melbourne after passing the Lucknow road.\n\nGlenarvan was undecided, and perhaps would have sent the order that\nAyrton so particularly desired, if the major had not opposed this plan\nwith great energy. He explained that Ayrton's presence was necessary\nto the expedition; that on approaching the coast the country would be\nunknown; that, if chance set them on the track of Captain Grant, the\nquartermaster would be more capable than any one else of following it;\nin short, that he alone could point out the place where the Britannia\nwas lost.\n\nMacNabb, therefore, advocated their continuing on the journey without\nchange. Captain Mangles was of the same opinion. The young captain\nobserved that his lordship's orders could more easily reach the Duncan\nif sent from Twofold Bay, than by dispatching a messenger two hundred\nmiles over a wild country.\n\nThe major carried his point, and it was therefore decided that they\nshould proceed to Twofold Bay. MacNabb noticed that Ayrton seemed quite\ndisappointed, but he said nothing, and, according to his custom, kept\nhis thoughts to himself.\n\nEarly in the afternoon they passed through a curious forest of ferns.\nThese arborescent plants, in full bloom, measured thirty feet in\nheight. Horses and horsemen could easily pass beneath their drooping\nbranches, and sometimes the rowel of a spur would ring, as it struck\nagainst their solid stalks. The coolness of the grove was very grateful\nto the wearied travelers. Paganel, always demonstrative, gave vent to\nexclamations of delight that startled flocks of parrots and cockatoos.\n\nAll at once his companions saw the geographer reel in the saddle, and\nfall to the ground like a log. Was it giddiness, or sunstroke, caused\nby the heat?\n\nThey hastened to him.\n\n\"Paganel! Paganel! what is the matter?\" cried Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\"The matter is, my dear friend,\" replied Paganel, extricating himself\nfrom the stirrups, \"that I no longer have a horse.\"\n\n\"What! your horse----?\"\n\n\"Is dead, stricken like Mulready's.\"\n\nAt once Glenarvan, Captain Mangles, and Wilson examined the animal.\nPaganel was right. His horse had been suddenly stricken dead.\n\n\"This is singular,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Very singular indeed,\" muttered the major.\n\nGlenarvan could not restrain a feeling of uneasiness at this strange\noccurrence. It was impossible for them to retrace their steps in this\ndesert; while, if an epidemic were to seize all the horses, it would be\nvery difficult to continue the journey.\n\nBefore the end of the day his fears seemed to be justified. A third\nhorse, Wilson's, fell dead, and, what was worse, one of the oxen was\nalso stricken. Their means of conveyance now consisted of only three\noxen and four horses.\n\n[Sidenote: A FINE FERNERY.]\n\nThe situation had grown serious. The mounted horsemen could, of course,\ntake turns in traveling on foot. But, if it should be necessary to\nleave the cart behind, what would become of the ladies? Could they\naccomplish the one hundred and twenty miles that still separated them\nfrom Twofold Bay?\n\nCaptain Mangles and Glenarvan anxiously examined the remaining horses:\nperhaps preventives might be found against new calamities. No sign\nof disease, however, could be detected. The animals were in perfect\nhealth, and bravely endured the hardships of the journey. Glenarvan,\ntherefore, was inclined to think that this mysterious epidemic would\nhave no more victims. This was Ayrton's opinion too, who declared that\nhe could not at all understand the cause of the frightful mortality.\n\nThey started again, and the cart served to convey the pedestrians, who\nrode in it by turns. At evening, after a journey of only ten miles, the\nsignal to halt was given, the encampment arranged, and the night was\npassed comfortably beneath a large group of arborescent ferns, among\nwhose branches fluttered enormous bats.", "The next day they made an excellent beginning, and accomplished fifteen\nmiles. Everything led them to hope that they would encamp that evening\non the banks of the Snowy River. Evening came, and a fog, clearly\ndefined against the horizon, marked the course of the long-looked-for\nstream. A forest of tall trees was seen at a bend in the road, behind\na moderate elevation. Ayrton guided his oxen towards the tall trunks\ndimly discerned in the shadow, and was just passing the boundary of the\nwood, when the cart sank into the earth to the hubs.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Glenarvan, when he perceived that the cart\nhad come to a stop.\n\n\"We are fast in the mud,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nHe urged his oxen with voice and whip, but they were up to their knees\nin the mire, and could not stir.\n\n\"Let us encamp here,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"That is the best plan,\" answered Ayrton. \"To-morrow, at daybreak, we\ncan see to extricate ourselves.\"\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon they passed through a curious\nforest of ferns. These arborescent plants, in full bloom, measured\nthirty feet in height.]\n\n[Illustration: Flashes of lightning, the dazzling forerunners of a\ncoming storm, every now and then illumined the horizon.]\n\n\"Very well: be it so,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\nNight had set in rapidly, after a short twilight, but the heat had not\ndeparted with the sun. The air was heavy with stifling mists. Flashes\nof lightning, the dazzling forerunners of a coming storm, every now and\nthen illumined the horizon.\n\nThe beds were prepared, and the sunken cart was made as comfortable as\npossible. The sombre arch of the great trees sheltered the tent of the\ntravelers. Provided no rain fell, they would have no reason to complain.\n\nAyrton succeeded with difficulty in extricating his three oxen from\nthe mud, in which they had by this time sunk to their flanks. The\nquartermaster picketed them with the four horses, and would allow no\none to give them their fodder. This service he performed himself with\ngreat exactness, and that evening Glenarvan observed that his care was\nredoubled, for which he thanked him, as the preservation of the team\nwas of paramount importance.\n\nMeantime, the travelers partook of a hasty supper. Fatigue and heat had\ndriven away hunger, and they needed rest more than nourishment. Lady\nHelena and Miss Grant, wishing their companions good-night, retired to\ntheir accustomed bedroom. As for the men, some crawled under the tent,\nwhile others stretched themselves on the thick grass at the foot of the\ntrees.\n\nGradually each sank into a heavy sleep. The darkness increased beneath\nthe curtain of dense clouds that covered the sky. Not a breath of\nair was felt. The silence of the night was only interrupted by the\noccasional howlings of wild animals.\n\nAbout eleven o'clock, after an uneasy slumber, the major awoke. His\nhalf-closed eyes were attracted by a dim light that flickered beneath\nthe great trees. One would have thought it was a whitish sheet\nglittering like the surface of a lake. MacNabb imagined, at first, that\nthe flames of a conflagration were spreading over the ground.\n\n[Sidenote: STRANGE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS.]\n\nHe rose and walked towards the wood. His surprise was great when\nhe found himself in the presence of a purely natural phenomenon.\nBefore him extended an immense field of mushrooms, which emitted\nphosphorescent flashes.\n\nThe major, who was not selfish, was about to waken Paganel, that the\ngeographer might witness the spectacle with his own eyes, when an\nunexpected sight stopped him.\n\nThe phosphorescent light illumined the wood for the space of half a\nmile, and MacNabb thought he saw shadows rapidly moving along the edge\nof the clearing. Did his eyes deceive him? Was he the sport of an\nillusion?\n\nHe crouched down, and, after a long and attentive observation,\ndistinctly perceived several men, who seemed by their movements to be\nsearching the ground for something. What could these men want? He must\nknow, and, without an instant's hesitation or awakening his companions,\nhe crawled along on all-fours, carefully concealing himself in the tall\ngrass.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nA STARTLING DISCOVERY.\n\n\n[Sidenote: INCREASING PERPLEXITIES.]\n\nIt was a terrible night. At two o'clock in the morning the rain began\nto fall in torrents, which continued to pour from the stormy clouds\ntill daylight. The tent was an insufficient shelter. Glenarvan and\nhis companions took refuge in the cart, where they passed the time\nin conversing upon various subjects. The major, however, whose short\nabsence no one had noticed, contented himself with listening in\nsilence. The fury of the tempest gave them considerable uneasiness,\nsince it might cause an inundation, by which the cart, fast in the\nmire, would be overwhelmed.\n\n[Illustration: He crouched down, and, after a long and attentive\nobservation, distinctly perceived several men.]\n\nMore than once Mulready, Ayrton, and Captain Mangles went to ascertain\nthe height of the rushing waters, and returned drenched from head to\nfoot.\n\nAt length day appeared. The rain ceased, but the rays of the sun failed\nto penetrate the thick veil of clouds. Large pools of muddy, yellowish\nwater covered the ground. A warm vapor issued from the water-soaked\nearth and saturated the atmosphere with a sickly moisture.\n\nGlenarvan, first of all, turned his attention to the cart. In his eyes,\nthis was their main support. It was imbedded fast in the midst of a\ndeep hollow of sticky clay. The fore wheels were almost entirely out of\nsight, and the hind ones were buried up to the hubs. It would be a very\ndifficult matter to pull out the heavy vehicle, and would undoubtedly\nrequire the united strength of men, oxen, and horses.\n\n\"We must make haste,\" said Captain Mangles. \"If this clay dries, the\nwork will be more difficult.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the two sailors, the captain, and Ayrton then entered the\nwood, where the animals had passed the night.\n\nIt was a tall forest of gloomy gum-trees. Nothing met the eye but dead\ntrunks, widely separated, which had been destitute of their bark for\ncenturies. Not a bird built its nest on these lofty skeletons; not a\nleaf trembled on the dry branches, that rattled together like a bundle\nof dry bones. Glenarvan, as he walked on, gazed at the leaden sky,\nagainst which the branches of the gum-trees were sharply defined. To\nAyrton's great astonishment, there was no trace of the horses and oxen\nin the place where he had left them. The fettered animals, however,\ncould not have gone far.\n\nThey searched for them in the wood, but failed to find them. Ayrton\nthen returned to the banks of the river, which was bordered by\nmagnificent mimosas. He uttered a cry well known to his oxen, but\nthere was no answer. The quartermaster seemed very anxious, and his\ncompanions glanced at each other in dismay.\n\nAn hour passed in a vain search, and Glenarvan was returning to the\ncart, which was at least a mile off, when a neigh fell upon his ear,\nfollowed almost immediately by a bellow.\n\n\"Here they are!\" cried Captain Mangles, forcing his way between the\ntall tufts of the gastrolobium, which were high enough to conceal a\nwhole herd.\n\nGlenarvan, Mulready, and Ayrton rushed after him, and soon shared his\nastonishment. Two oxen and three horses lay upon the ground, stricken\nlike the others. Their bodies were already cold, and a flock of hungry\ncrows, croaking in the mimosas, waited for their unexpected prey.\n\nGlenarvan and his friends gazed at each other, and Wilson did not\nsuppress an oath that rose to his lips.\n\n\"What is the matter, Wilson?\" said Lord Glenarvan, scarcely able to\ncontrol himself. \"We can do nothing. Ayrton, bring the ox and horse\nthat are left. They must extricate us from the difficulty.\"\n\n\"If the cart were once out of the mud,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"these\ntwo animals, by short journeys, could draw it to the coast. We must,\ntherefore, at all events, release the clumsy vehicle.\"\n\n\"We will try, John,\" said Glenarvan. \"Let us return to camp, for there\nmust be anxiety at our long absence.\"\n\nAyrton took charge of the ox, and Mulready of the horse, and the party\nreturned along the winding banks of the river. Half an hour after,\nPaganel, MacNabb, Lady Helena, and Miss Grant were told the state of\naffairs.\n\n\"By my faith,\" the major could not help exclaiming, \"it is a pity,\nAyrton, that you did not shoe all our animals on crossing the Wimerra.\"\n\n\"Why so, sir?\" asked Ayrton.\n\n\"Because of all our horses only the one you put into the hands of the\nfarrier has escaped the common fate.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Captain Mangles; \"and it is a singular\ncoincidence!\"\n\n[Sidenote: MISTAKES AND MISAPPREHENSIONS.]\n\n\"A coincidence, and nothing more,\" replied the quartermaster, gazing\nfixedly at the major.\n\nMacNabb compressed his lips, as if he would repress the words ready\nto burst from them. Glenarvan, the captain, and Lady Helena seemed to\nexpect that he would finish his sentence; but he remained silent, and\nwalked towards the cart, which Ayrton was now examining.\n\n\"What did he mean?\" inquired Glenarvan of Captain Mangles.\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied the young captain. \"However, the major is not\nthe man to speak without cause.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lady Helena; \"Major MacNabb must have suspicions of Ayrton.\"\n\n\"What suspicions?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Does he suppose him capable of\nkilling our horses and oxen? For what purpose, pray? Are not Ayrton's\ninterests identical with ours?\"\n\n\"You are right, my dear Edward,\" said Lady Helena. \"Besides, the\nquartermaster has given us, ever since the beginning of the journey,\nindubitable proofs of his devotion to our comfort.\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"But, then, what does the major's\nremark mean? I must have an understanding.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he thinks he is in league with these convicts?\" remarked\nPaganel, imprudently.\n\n\"What convicts?\" inquired Miss Grant.\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel is mistaken,\" said Captain Mangles quickly: \"he knows\nthat there are no convicts in the province of Victoria.\"", "\"What convicts?\" inquired Miss Grant.\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel is mistaken,\" said Captain Mangles quickly: \"he knows\nthat there are no convicts in the province of Victoria.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is so,\" eagerly replied Paganel, who would fain have\nretracted his words. \"What could I have been thinking of? Convicts? Who\never heard of convicts in Australia? Moreover, as soon as they land,\nthey make very honest people. The climate, you know, Miss Mary, the\nmoral effect of the climate----\"\n\nIn his desire to correct his blunder, the poor geographer became\nhopelessly involved. Lady Helena looked at him, wondering what had\ndeprived him of his usual coolness; but, not wishing to embarrass him\nfurther, she retired with Mary to the tent, where Mr. Olbinett was\nengaged in preparing breakfast.\n\n\"I deserve to be transported myself,\" said Paganel piteously.\n\n\"I think so,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\nAyrton and the two sailors were still trying to extricate the cart.\nThe ox and the horse, yoked side by side, were pulling with all their\nstrength; the traces were stretched almost to breaking, and the bows\nthreatened to give way to the strain. Wilson and Mulready pushed at\nthe wheels, while the quartermaster, with voice and whip, urged on the\nill-matched team. But the heavy vehicle did not stir. The clay, now\ndry, held it as if it had been cemented.\n\nCaptain Mangles wetted the clay to make it yield, but to no purpose:\nthe cart was immovable. Unless the vehicle was taken to pieces, they\nmust give up the idea of getting it out of the quagmire. As tools\nwere wanting, of course they could not undertake such a task. Ayrton,\nhowever, who seemed determined to overcome the difficulty at any cost,\nwas about to renew his exertions, when Lord Glenarvan stopped him.\n\n\"Enough, Ayrton! enough!\" said he. \"We must be careful of the ox and\nhorse that remain. If we are to continue our journey on foot, one can\ncarry the two ladies and the other the provisions. They may do us good\nservice yet.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" replied the quartermaster, unyoking his exhausted\nanimals.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" added Glenarvan, \"let us return to camp, deliberate,\nconsider our situation, know what our chances are, and come to a\nresolution.\"\n\n[Illustration: But the heavy vehicle did not stir. The clay, now dry,\nheld it as if it had been cemented.]\n\nA few minutes after, the travelers were indemnifying themselves for\ntheir sleeplessness the past night by a good breakfast, and the\ndiscussion of their affairs began.\n\nThe first question was to determine the exact position of the\nencampment. Paganel was charged with this duty, and fulfilled it with\nhis customary precision.\n\n\"How far are we from Twofold Bay?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Seventy-five miles,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"And Melbourne is----?\"\n\n\"Two hundred miles distant, at least.\"\n\n\"Very well. Our position being determined,\" continued Glenarvan, \"what\nis it best to do?\"\n\nThe answer was unanimous,--make for the coast without delay. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant engaged to travel fifteen miles a day. The\ncourageous women did not shrink from traversing the entire distance on\nfoot, if necessary.\n\n\"But are we certain to find at the bay the resources that we need?\"\nasked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Without doubt,\" replied Paganel. \"Eden is not a new municipality; and\nits harbor must have frequent communication with Melbourne. I even\nbelieve that thirty-five miles from here, at the parish of Delegete, we\ncan obtain provisions and the means of conveyance.\"\n\n\"And the Duncan?\" asked Ayrton. \"Do you not think it advisable to order\nher to the bay?\"\n\n\"What say you, captain?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"I do not think that there is any necessity for such a proceeding,\"\nreplied the young captain, after reflection. \"There will be plenty of\ntime to send your orders to Tom Austin and summon him to the coast.\"\n\n\"That is quite true,\" added Paganel.\n\n\"Besides,\" continued Captain Mangles, \"in four or five days we shall be\nat Eden.\"\n\n\"Four or five days!\" interposed Ayrton, shaking his head; \"say fifteen\nor twenty, captain, if you do not wish to regret your error hereafter.\"\n\n[Sidenote: DIFFICULTIES FORESEEN.]\n\n\"Fifteen or twenty days to make seventy-five miles!\" exclaimed\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"At least, my lord. You will have to cross the most difficult portion\nof Victoria,--plains covered with underbrush, without any cleared\nroads, where it has been impossible to establish stations. You will\nhave to travel with the hatchet or the torch in your hand; and, believe\nme, you will not advance rapidly.\"\n\nAyrton's tone was that of a man who is thoroughly acquainted with his\nsubject. Paganel, towards whom questioning glances were turned, nodded\napprovingly at the words of the quartermaster.\n\n\"I acknowledge the difficulties,\" said Captain Mangles, at length.\n\"Well, in fifteen days, my lord, you can send your orders to the\nDuncan.\"\n\n\"I may add,\" resumed Ayrton, \"that the principal obstacles do not\nproceed from the roughness of the journey. We must cross the Snowy,\nand, very probably, have to wait for the subsidence of the waters.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" cried the captain. \"Can we not find a ford?\"\n\n\"I think not,\" replied Ayrton. \"This morning I searched in vain for a\npracticable one. It is unusual to find a river so much swollen at this\nseason; it is a fatality against which I am powerless.\"\n\n\"This Snowy River is broad, then?\" remarked Lady Glenarvan.\n\n\"Broad and deep, madam,\" answered Ayrton; \"a mile in breadth, with a\nstrong current. A good swimmer could not cross it without danger.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let us build a boat!\" cried Robert, who was never at fault\nfor a plan. \"We can cut down a tree, hollow it out, embark, and the\nthing is done.\"\n\n\"Good for the son of Captain Grant!\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"The boy is right,\" continued Captain Mangles. \"We shall be forced\nto this. I therefore think it useless to waste our time in further\ndiscussions.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Ayrton?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, my lord, that if no assistance comes, in a month we shall\nstill be detained on the banks of the Snowy.\"\n\n\"But have you a better plan?\" inquired Captain Mangles, somewhat\nimpatiently.\n\n\"Yes; let the Duncan leave Melbourne, and sail to the eastern coast.\"\n\n\"How can her presence in the bay assist us to arrive there?\"\n\nAyrton meditated for a few moments, and then said, evasively:\n\n\"I do not wish to obtrude my opinion. What I do is for the interest\nof all, and I am disposed to start as soon as your lordship gives the\nsignal for departure.\"\n\nThen he folded his arms.\n\n\"That is no answer, Ayrton,\" continued Glenarvan. \"Tell us your plan,\nand we will discuss it. What do you propose?\"\n\nIn a calm and confident tone the quartermaster thereupon expressed\nhimself as follows:\n\n\"I propose that we do not venture beyond the Snowy in our present\ndestitute condition. We must wait for assistance in this very place,\nand this assistance can come only from the Duncan. Let us encamp here\nwhere provisions are not wanting, while one of us carries to Tom Austin\nthe order to repair to Twofold Bay.\"\n\nThis unexpected proposal was received with a murmur of astonishment,\nand Captain Mangles took no pains to conceal his aversion.\n\n\"In the mean time,\" continued Ayrton, \"either the waters of the Snowy\nwill have subsided, which will enable us to find a practicable ford, or\nwe shall have to resort to a boat, and shall have time to construct it.\nThis, my lord, is the plan which I submit to your approval.\"\n\n\"Very well, Ayrton,\" replied Glenarvan; \"your idea deserves to be\nseriously considered. Its greatest objection is the delay it will\ncause; but it spares us severe hardships, and perhaps real dangers.\nWhat do you think, friends?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"If it please your lordship, I will go.\"]\n\n\"Let us hear your advice, major,\" said Lady Helena. \"During the whole\ndiscussion you have contented yourself with listening simply.\"\n\n\"Since you ask my opinion,\" answered the major, \"I will give it to you\nvery frankly. Ayrton seems to me to have spoken like a wise and prudent\nman, and I advocate his proposition.\"\n\nThis answer was rather unexpected; for hitherto MacNabb had always\nopposed Ayrton's ideas on this subject. Ayrton, too, was surprised,\nand cast a quick glance at the major. Paganel, Lady Helena, and the\nsailors had been favorably disposed to the quartermaster's project, and\nno longer hesitated after MacNabb's declaration. Glenarvan, therefore,\nannounced that Ayrton's plan was adopted.\n\n\"And now, captain,\" added he, \"do you not think that prudence dictates\nthis course, and that we should encamp on the banks of the river while\nwaiting for the means of conveyance?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"if the messenger succeeds in crossing\nthe Snowy, which we cannot cross ourselves.\"\n\nAll looked at the quartermaster, who smiled with the air of a man who\nknows perfectly well what he is about to do.\n\n\"The messenger will not cross the river,\" said he.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Mangles.\n\n\"He will strike the Lucknow road, which will take him direct to\nMelbourne.\"\n\n\"Two hundred miles on foot!\" exclaimed the captain.\n\n\"On horseback,\" continued Ayrton. \"There is one good horse left. It\nwill be a journey of but four days. Add two days for the Duncan to\nreach the bay, twenty-four hours for the return to the encampment, and\nin a week the messenger will be back again with the crew.\"\n\n[Sidenote: CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE.]\n\nThe major again nodded approvingly at these words, to the great\nastonishment of Captain Mangles. But the quartermaster's proposition\nhad gained all the votes, and the only question was how to execute this\napparently well-conceived plan.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"it remains only to choose our\nmessenger. He will have a difficult and dangerous mission; that is\ncertain. Who is willing to devote himself for his companions, and carry\nour instructions to Melbourne?\"", "Wilson, Mulready, Captain Mangles, Paganel, and Robert offered\nthemselves immediately. The captain particularly insisted that this\nmission should be confided to him; but Ayrton, who had not yet\nfinished, resumed the conversation, and said:\n\n\"If it please your lordship, I will go. I am acquainted with the\ncountry, and have often crossed more difficult regions. I can extricate\nmyself where another would fail. I therefore claim, for the common\nwelfare, the right to go to Melbourne. One word will place me on a good\nfooting with your mate, and in six days I engage to bring the Duncan to\nTwofold Bay.\"\n\n\"Well said!\" replied Glenarvan. \"You are a brave and intelligent man,\nAyrton, and will succeed.\"\n\nThe quartermaster was evidently more capable than any one else of\nfulfilling this difficult mission. Captain Mangles raised one final\nobjection, that Ayrton's presence was necessary to enable them to\nfind traces of the Brittania or Captain Grant; but the major observed\nthat they should remain encamped on the banks of the Snowy till the\nmessenger's return, that it was not proposed to resume the search\nwithout him, and that consequently his absence could be in no way\nprejudicial to their interests.\n\n\"Well then, Ayrton, start,\" said Glenarvan. \"Make haste, and return to\nthe encampment by way of Eden.\"\n\nA gleam of satisfaction seemed to light up the eyes of the\nquartermaster. He turned his head to one side, though not so quickly\nbut that Captain Mangles had intercepted his glance, and instinctively\nfelt his suspicions increased.\n\nThe quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the\ntwo sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his\nprovisions. Meantime Glenarvan wrote the letter designed for Tom Austin.\n\nHe ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold\nBay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could\nplace entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton.\n\nHe had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton.\n\n\"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE PLOT UNVEILED.\n\n\nThe sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet.\n\nBefore Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees.\n\n[Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.]\n\nThe tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen.\n\n\"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides.\n\nThe captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence.\n\nThese events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared.\n\nThe major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees.\n\n\"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\"\n\n[Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.]\n\nThe major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour.\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant's first care had been to dress Glenarvan's\nwound. At the very moment that her husband fell, from Ben Joyce's\nbullet, in her terror she had rushed towards him. Then, controlling\nher emotion, this courageous woman had assisted Glenarvan to the cart.\nHere the shoulder of the wounded man was laid bare, and the major\nperceived that the ball had lacerated the flesh, causing no other\ninjury. Neither bones nor large muscles seemed affected. The wound bled\nconsiderably, but Glenarvan, by moving the fingers of his hand and\nfore-arm, encouraged his friends to expect a favorable result. When his\nwound was dressed, he no longer desired any attention, and explanations\nfollowed. The travelers, except Wilson and Mulready, who were keeping\nguard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the\nmajor was requested to speak.\n\nBefore beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of\na band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of\nVictoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her\nthe number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at\nSeymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben\nJoyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a\nwide-spread notoriety.\n\nBut how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster\nAyrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major\nexplained.\n\nSince the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or\nthree almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between\nthe quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation\nto pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the\nDuncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his\ncare, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these\nfacts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions.\n\nHowever, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had\ntranspired the preceding night. Gliding between the tall clumps of\nshrubbery, as was related in the previous chapter, he approached near\nthe suspicious shadows that had attracted his attention half a mile\nfrom the encampment. The phosphorescent plants cast their pale rays\nthrough the darkness. Three men were examining some tracks on the\nground, and among them he recognized the farrier of Black Point Station.\n\n\"Here they are,\" said one.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied another, \"here is the trefoil of the hoofs again.\"\n\n\"It has been like this since leaving the Wimerra.\"\n\n\"All the horses are dead.\"\n\n\"The poison is not far away.\"\n\n\"There is enough here to settle an entire troop of cavalry. This\ngastrolobium is a useful plant.\"\n\n\"Then they were silent,\" added MacNabb, \"and departed. I wanted to know\nmore: I followed them. The conversation soon began again. 'A cunning\nman, this Ben Joyce,' said the farrier; 'a famous quartermaster, with\nhis invented shipwreck. If his plan succeeds, it will be a stroke of\nfortune. Devilish Ayrton! Call him Ben Joyce, for he has well earned\nhis name.' These rascals then left the wood of gum-trees. I knew what\nI wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all\nthe convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's\narguments.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, \"Ayrton has\nbrought us here to rob and assassinate us?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major.\n\n\"And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us,\nwaiting for a favorable opportunity?\"\n\n[Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.]\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen\nhis name and contract?\"\n\nAll eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this\nmatter.\n\n\"These,\" replied he, in his calm voice, \"are the proofs that can be\nderived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay. Here is a mystery that the future will explain.\"\n\n\"The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,\"\nsaid Captain Mangles.\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied the major; \"and such information would\nbe likely to facilitate their search.\"\n\n\"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\"", "\"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of it,\" continued MacNabb. \"He was meditating\nsome hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was\noffered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the name of her father rose to her lips.\n\nThe discovery of Ayrton's treachery destroyed all hope. The convict, to\nentice Glenarvan on, had invented a shipwreck. In their conversation,\noverheard by MacNabb, his accomplices had clearly confessed it. The\nBritannia had never been wrecked on the reefs of Twofold Bay! Harry\nGrant had never set foot on the Australian continent!\n\nFor the second time an erroneous interpretation of the document had set\nthe searchers of the Britannia on a false trail. All, in the face of\nthis situation and the grief of the two children, preserved a mournful\nsilence. Who then could have found words of hope? Robert wept in his\nsister's arms. Paganel murmured, in a voice of despair,--\n\n[Sidenote: CALM AND CLOUDINESS.]\n\n\"Ah, unlucky document! You can boast of having sorely puzzled the\nbrains of a dozen brave people!\"\n\nAnd the worthy geographer was fairly furious against himself, and\nfrantically beat his forehead.\n\nIn the mean time Glenarvan had joined Mulready and Wilson, who were on\nguard without. A deep silence reigned on the plain lying between the\nwood and the river. Heavy clouds covered the vault of the sky. In this\ndeadened and torpid atmosphere the least sound would have been clearly\ntransmitted; but nothing was heard. Ben Joyce and his band must have\nfled to a considerable distance; for flocks of birds that sported on\nthe low branches of the trees, several kangaroos peacefully browsing on\nthe young shoots, and a pair of cassowaries, whose unsuspecting heads\nwere thrust between the tall bushes, proved that the presence of man\ndid not disturb these peaceful solitudes.\n\n\"You have not seen nor heard anything for an hour?\" inquired Glenarvan\nof the two sailors.\n\n\"Nothing, my lord,\" replied Wilson. \"The convicts must be several miles\naway.\"\n\n\"They cannot have been in sufficient force to attack us,\" added\nMulready. \"This Ben Joyce probably intended to recruit some bandits,\nlike himself, among the bushrangers that wander at the foot of the\nAlps.\"\n\n\"Very likely, Mulready,\" replied Glenarvan. \"These rascals are cowards.\nThey know we are well armed, and are perhaps waiting for darkness to\ncommence their attack. We must redouble our vigilance at nightfall. If\nwe could only leave this marshy plain and pursue our journey towards\nthe coast! But the swollen waters of the river bar our progress. I\nwould pay its weight in gold for a raft that would transport us to the\nother side!\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Wilson, \"does not your lordship give us the order to\nconstruct this raft? There is plenty of wood.\"\n\n\"No, Wilson,\" answered Glenarvan; \"this Snowy is not a river, it is an\nimpassable torrent.\"\n\n[Illustration: A pair of cassowaries proved that the presence of man\ndid not disturb these peaceful solitudes.]\n\n[Sidenote: READINESS FOR SERVICE.]\n\nAt this moment Captain Mangles, the major, and Paganel joined\nGlenarvan. They had been to examine the Snowy. The waters, swollen by\nthe recent rains, had risen a foot above low-water mark, and formed\nan impetuous current. It was impossible to venture upon this roaring\ndeluge, these rushing floods, broken into a thousand eddies by the\ndepressions of the river-bed. Captain Mangles declared that the passage\nwas impracticable.\n\n\"But,\" added he, \"we ought not to remain here without making any\nattempt. What we wished to do before Ayrton's treason is still more\nnecessary now.\"\n\n\"What do you say, captain?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I say that assistance is needed; and since we cannot go to Twofold\nBay, we must go to Melbourne. One horse is left. Let your lordship give\nhim to me, and I will go.\"\n\n\"But it is a perilous venture, John,\" said Glenarvan. \"Aside from the\ndangers of this journey of two hundred miles across an unknown country,\nall the roads may be guarded by Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\n\"I know it, my lord; but I know, too, that our situation cannot be\nprolonged. Ayrton only asked eight days' absence to bring back the crew\nof the Duncan. But I will return in six days to the banks of the Snowy.\nWhat are your lordship's orders?\"\n\n\"Before Glenarvan speaks,\" said Paganel, \"I must make a remark. It is\nwell that one of us should go to Melbourne, but not that these dangers\nshould be incurred by Captain Mangles. He is the captain of the Duncan,\nand must not, therefore, expose himself. Allow me to go in his place.\"\n\n\"Well said,\" replied the major; \"but why should it be you, Paganel?\"\n\n\"Are we not here?\" cried Wilson and Mulready.\n\n\"And do you believe,\" continued MacNabb, \"that I am afraid to make a\njourney of two hundred miles on horseback?\"\n\n\"My friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"if one of us is to go to Melbourne, let\nfate decide. Paganel, write our names----\"\n\n\"Not yours at least, my lord,\" insisted Captain Mangles.\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Separate you from Lady Helena, when your wound is not yet healed?\"\n\n\"Glenarvan,\" interposed Paganel, \"you cannot leave the encampment.\"\n\n\"No,\" resumed the major; \"your place is here. Edward, you must not go.\"\n\n\"There are dangers to incur,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and I will not leave\nmy part to others. Write, Paganel; let my name be mingled with those of\nmy companions, and Heaven grant that it may be the first drawn.\"\n\nAll yielded to this wish; and Glenarvan's name was added to the others.\nThey then proceeded to draw, and the lot fell upon Mulready. The brave\nsailor uttered a cry of joy.\n\n\"My lord, I am ready to go,\" said he.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his hand, and then turned towards the cart, leaving\nthe major and Captain Mangles to guard the encampment. Lady Helena\nwas at once informed of the decision taken to send a messenger to\nMelbourne, and of the result of the drawing by lot. She spoke words to\nMulready that went to the heart of that noble sailor. They knew that he\nwas brave, intelligent, hardy, and persevering. The lot could not have\nfallen better.\n\nIt was decided that Mulready should depart at eight o'clock, after the\nshort twilight. Wilson charged himself with getting the horse ready. He\ntook the precaution to change the tell-tale shoe that he wore on his\nleft foot, and to replace it by one belonging to the horses that had\ndied in the night. The convicts could not now track Mulready, or follow\nhim, unless mounted.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER DISTRACTION.]\n\nWhile Wilson was occupied with these arrangements, Glenarvan was\npreparing the letter designed for Tom Austin; but his wounded arm\ndisabled him, and he asked Paganel to write for him. The geographer,\nwho seemed absorbed in one idea, was oblivious to what was passing\naround him. It must be confessed that Paganel, in all this succession\nof sad misfortunes, thought only of his false interpretation of the\ndocument. He turned the words about in every way to draw from them a\nnew meaning, and remained wrapt in these meditations. Thus he did not\nhear Glenarvan's request, and the latter was forced to repeat it.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Paganel; \"I am ready.\"\n\nSo saying, he mechanically produced his note-book. He tore out a blank\npage, and then, with his pencil in his hand, made ready to write.\nGlenarvan began to dictate the following instructions:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan----\"\n\nPaganel had just finished this last word when his eyes fell upon the\nnumber of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ that lay upon the\nground. The paper, being folded, only allowed him to see the two last\nsyllables of its title. His pencil stopped, and he seemed to completely\nforget Glenarvan and his letter.\n\n\"Well, Paganel?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Ah!\" continued the geographer, uttering a cry.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Nothing! nothing!\" replied Paganel. Then, in a lower tone, he\nrepeated: \"Aland! aland! aland!\"\n\nHe had risen; he had seized the paper. He shook it, seeking to\nrepress words ready to escape his lips. Lady Helena, Mary, Robert,\nand Glenarvan gazed at him without understanding this inexplicable\nagitation. Paganel was like a man whom a sudden frenzy has seized. But\nthis state of nervous excitation did not last. He gradually grew calm.\nThe joy that gleamed in his eyes died away, and, resuming his place, he\nsaid, in a quiet tone:\n\n\"When you wish, my lord, I am at your disposal.\"\n\nGlenarvan continued the dictation of his letter, which was distinctly\nworded as follows:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of Australia.\"", "Glenarvan continued the dictation of his letter, which was distinctly\nworded as follows:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of Australia.\"\n\n\"Australia?\" cried Paganel. \"Ah, yes, Australia!\"\n\nThe letter was now finished, and presented to Glenarvan for his\nsignature, who, although affected by his recent wound, acquitted\nhimself as well as possible of this formality. The note was then\nfolded and sealed, while Paganel, with a hand that still trembled from\nexcitement, wrote the following address:\n\n                         \"Tom Austin,\n                             \"Mate of the Yacht Duncan,\n                                      \"Melbourne.\"\n\nThereupon he left the cart, gesticulating, and repeating these\nincomprehensible words:\n\n\"Aland! aland! Zealand!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nFOUR DAYS OF ANGUISH.\n\n\nThe rest of the day passed without any other incident. Everything was\nready for the departure of Mulready, who was happy to give his master\nthis proof of his devotion.\n\nPaganel had regained his coolness and accustomed manners. His look\nstill indicated an uneasy state of mind, but he appeared decided to\nkeep his secret. He had doubtless strong reasons for acting thus,\nfor the major overheard him repeating these words, like a man who is\nstruggling with himself:\n\n\"No, no! they would not believe me! And, besides what use is it? It is\ntoo late!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Adieu, my lord,\" said he, in a calm voice, and soon\ndisappeared by a path along the edge of the wood.]\n\nThis resolution taken, he occupied himself with giving Mulready the\nnecessary directions for reaching Melbourne, and, with the map before\nhim, marked out his course. All the trails of the prairie converged\ntowards the Lucknow road, which, after extending straight southward to\nthe coast, suddenly turned in the direction towards Melbourne. It was\nsimply necessary to follow this, and not attempt to cross the unknown\ncountry. Mulready could not, therefore, go astray. As for dangers, they\nlay only a few miles beyond the encampment, where Ben Joyce and his\nband were probably lying in wait. This point once passed, Mulready was\nsure he could easily distance the convicts and accomplish his important\nmission.\n\nAt six o'clock supper was eaten in common. A heavy rain was falling.\nThe tent no longer afforded sufficient shelter, and each had taken\nrefuge in the cart, which was a safe retreat. The sticky clay held\nit in its place as firm as a fort on its foundations. The fire-arms\nconsisted of seven rifles and seven revolvers, and thus enabled\nthem to sustain a long siege, for neither ammunition nor provisions\nwere wanting. In six days the Duncan would anchor in Twofold Bay.\nTwenty-four hours after, her crew would reach the opposite bank of\nthe river; and, if the passage was not then practicable, at least the\nconvicts would be compelled to retreat before superior forces. But,\nfirst of all, it was necessary that Mulready should succeed in his\nenterprise.\n\nAt eight o'clock the darkness became intense. It was the time to start.\nThe horse was brought out. His feet had been muffled; as an additional\nprecaution, and made no sound. The animal seemed fatigued, but upon\nhis surefootedness and endurance depended the safety of all. The\nmajor advised the sailor to spare his beast as soon as he was out of\nreach of the convicts. It was better to lose half a day and reach his\ndestination safely. Captain Mangles gave him a revolver, which he had\nloaded with the greatest care. Mulready mounted.\n\n[Sidenote: A GLOOMY PROSPECT.]\n\n\"Here is the letter which you are to take to Tom Austin,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"Let him not lose an hour, but start for Twofold Bay; and,\nif he does not find us there, if we have not crossed the river, let him\ncome to us without delay. Now go, my brave sailor, and may God guide\nyou!\"\n\nGlenarvan, Lady Helena, Mary Grant, all clasped Mulready's hand. This\ndeparture on a dark and stormy night, over a road beset with dangers,\nacross the unknown stretches of a desert, would have appalled a heart\nless courageous than that of the sailor.\n\n\"Adieu, my lord,\" said he, in a calm voice, and soon disappeared by a\npath along the edge of the wood.\n\nAt that moment the tempest redoubled its violence. The lofty branches\nof the trees shook dismally in the darkness. You could hear the fall of\nthe dry twigs on the drenched earth. More than one giant tree, whose\nsap was gone, but which had stood till then, fell during this terrible\nhurricane. The wind roared amid the cracking of the trees and mingled\nits mournful sounds with the rushing of the river. The heavy clouds\nthat chased across the sky poured forth masses of mist, while a dismal\ndarkness increased still more the horrors of the night.\n\nThe travelers, after Mulready's departure, ensconced themselves in the\ncart. Lady Helena, Mary Grant, Glenarvan, and Paganel occupied the\nfront compartment, which had been made water-tight. In the rear part\nOlbinett, Wilson, and Robert had found a sufficient shelter, while the\nmajor and Captain Mangles were on guard without. This precaution was\nnecessary, for an attack by the convicts was easy and possible.\n\nThese two faithful guardians, therefore, took turns and philosophically\nreceived the blasts that blew sharply in their faces. They strove to\npierce with their eyes the shades so favorable for an ambuscade, for\nthe ear could detect nothing amid the din of the storm, the roaring of\nthe wind, the rattling of the branches, the fall of trees, and the\nrushing of the impetuous waters.\n\nIn the mean time there were several lulls in the fury of the tempest,\nthe wind ceasing as if to take breath. The river only moaned adown\nthe motionless reeds and the black curtain of the gum-trees, and the\nsilence seemed more profound during these momentary rests. The major\nand Captain Mangles now listened attentively. During one of these\nintervals a sharp whistle reached their ears.\n\nThe captain hastened to the major. \"Did you hear anything?\" asked he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied MacNabb. \"Was it a man or an animal?\"\n\n\"A man,\" said the captain.\n\nThey both listened again. The mysterious whistle was suddenly repeated,\nand something like a report followed it, but almost inaudibly, for the\nstorm just then broke forth with renewed violence. They could not hear\nthemselves talk, and took their stations to leeward of the cart.\n\nAt this moment the leathern curtains were raised, and Glenarvan joined\nhis two companions. He likewise had heard the suspicious whistle, and\nthe report.\n\n\"From what direction?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yonder,\" said the captain, pointing to the dark line, towards which\nMulready had gone.\n\n\"How far?\"\n\n\"The wind carried it,\" was the reply. \"It must be three miles distant\nat least.\"\n\n\"Let us go!\" said Glenarvan, throwing his rifle over his shoulder.\n\n\"No,\" interposed the major; \"it is a decoy to entice us away from the\ncart.\"\n\n\"But if Mulready has fallen beneath the shots of these wretches!\"\ncontinued Glenarvan, seizing MacNabb's hand.\n\n\"We shall know to-morrow,\" replied the latter, firmly determined to\nprevent Glenarvan from committing a useless imprudence.\n\n[Sidenote: A CRY IN THE NIGHT.]\n\n\"You cannot leave the encampment, my lord,\" said Captain Mangles; \"I\nwill go alone.\"\n\n\"No!\" cried MacNabb, with energy. \"Will you have us, then, perish\nsingly, diminish our numbers, and be left to the mercy of these\ncriminals? If Mulready has been their victim, it is a calamity that we\nmust not repeat a second time. He has gone according to lot. If the lot\nhad chosen me, I should have gone like him, but should neither have\nasked nor expected any assistance.\"\n\nIn restraining Glenarvan and Captain Mangles the major was right from\nevery point of view. To attempt to reach the sailor, to go on such\na dark night to meet the convicts, ambuscaded in some coppice, was\nuseless madness. Glenarvan's little party did not number enough men to\nsacrifice any more.\n\nHowever, Glenarvan seemed unwilling to yield to these reasons. His\nhand played nervously with his rifle. He walked to and fro around the\ncart; he listened to the least sound; he strove to pierce the dismal\nobscurity. The thought that one of his friends was mortally wounded,\nhelplessly abandoned, calling in vain upon those for whose sake he\nhad sacrificed himself, tortured him. MacNabb feared that he should\nnot succeed in restraining him, that Glenarvan, carried away by his\nfeelings, would cast himself into the power of Ben Joyce.\n\n\"Edward,\" said he, \"be calm; listen to a friend; think of Lady Helena,\nMary Grant, all who remain! Besides, where will you go? Where find\nMulready? He was attacked two miles distant at least. On what road?\nWhat path take?\"\n\nAt this very moment, as if in answer to the major, a cry of distress\nwas heard.\n\n\"Listen!\" said Glenarvan.\n\nThe cry came from the very direction whence the report had sounded, but\nless than a quarter of a mile distant. Glenarvan, pushing back MacNabb,\nwas advancing along the path, when, not far from the cart, these words\nwere uttered:\n\n\"Help! help!\"\n\nIt was a plaintive and despairing voice. Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees.\nIn the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready.\n\nOn arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side.", "MacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth,\nwhile the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had\nbeen seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening\nof the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of\ntinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus\nsucceeded in stopping the hemorrhage. The patient was then laid on his\nside, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing\ndraught.\n\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been\nmotionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips\nmurmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard\nhim say:\n\n\"My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.]\n\nThe major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone.\n\nThe night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that\nthe wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands.\n\nDay appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper.\n\nCaptain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight.\n\nGlenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence\nforbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the\nseriousness of the situation.\n\n\"We cannot think of sending another messenger to Melbourne,\" said he.\n\n\"But we must,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"and I will make the attempt,\nsince my sailor has failed.\"\n\n\"No, John. You have not even a horse to carry you these two hundred\nmiles.\"\n\nIndeed, Mulready's horse, the only one that remained, had not\nreappeared. Had he fallen beneath the shots of the murderers? Was he\nrunning wild over the desert? Had the convicts captured him?\n\n[Illustration: In the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the\nmajor, and the captain bore the body of Mulready.]\n\n[Sidenote: RESOLUTION, AND RECOVERY.]\n\n\"Whatever happens,\" continued Glenarvan, \"we will separate no more.\nLet us wait eight or fifteen days, till the waters of the river resume\ntheir natural level. We will then reach Twofold Bay by short journeys,\nand from there send to the Duncan by a surer way the order to sail for\nthe coast.\"\n\n\"This is the only feasible plan,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Well, then, my friends,\" resumed Glenarvan, \"no more separation! A\nman risks too much to venture alone across this desert, infested with\nbandits. And now may God save our poor sailor and protect ourselves!\"\n\nGlenarvan was right in both resolves, first to forbid any single\nattempt to cross the plains, and next to wait patiently on the banks\nof the river for a practicable passage. Scarcely thirty-five miles\nseparated them from Delegete, the first frontier town of New South\nWales, where they would find means of reaching Twofold Bay. From this\npoint he could telegraph his orders to the Duncan.\n\nThese measures were wise, but they had been adopted rather tardily. If\nthey had not sent Mulready with the letter, what misfortunes would have\nbeen avoided, not to speak of the attack upon the sailor!\n\nOn arriving at the camp, Glenarvan found his companions less anxious;\nthey seemed to have regained hope.\n\n\"He is better!\" cried Robert, running to meet him.\n\n\"Mulready?\"\n\n\"Yes, Edward,\" replied Lady Helena. \"A reaction has taken place. The\nmajor is more encouraged. Our sailor will live.\"\n\n\"Where is MacNabb?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"With him. Mulready wished to speak with him. We must not disturb them.\"\n\nIndeed, within an hour the wounded man had rallied from his swoon, and\nthe fever had diminished. But the sailor's first care, on recovering\nmemory and speech was to ask for Lord Glenarvan, or, in his absence,\nthe major MacNabb, seeing him so feeble, would have forbidden all\nconversation; but Mulready insisted with such energy that he was forced\nto yield. The interview had already lasted some time, and they were\nonly waiting for the major's report.\n\nSoon the curtains of the cart moved, and he appeared. He joined his\nfriends at the foot of a gum-tree. His face, usually so calm, betokened\na serious anxiety. When his eyes encountered Lady Helena and the young\ngirl, they expressed a deep sadness. Glenarvan questioned him, and\nlearned what the sailor had related.\n\nOn leaving the encampment, Mulready had followed one of the paths\nindicated by Paganel. He hastened, as much at least as the darkness of\nthe night permitted him. According to his estimate, he had traveled a\ndistance of about two miles, when several men--five, he thought--sprang\nto his horse's head. The animal reared. Mulready seized his revolver\nand fired. He thought that two of his assailants fell. By the flash of\nthe report, he recognized Ben Joyce, but that was all. He had not time\nto fully discharge his weapon. A violent blow was struck upon his right\nside, which brought him to the ground. However, he had not yet lost\nconsciousness. The assassins believed him dead. He felt them search\nhim. Then a conversation ensued. \"I have the letter,\" said one of them.\n\"Give it to me,\" replied Ben Joyce; \"and now the Duncan is ours!\"\n\nAt this point in the story Glenarvan could not restrain a cry.\n\nMacNabb continued:\n\n[Sidenote: A HOPELESS CHANCE.]\n\n\"'Now, you others,' said Ben Joyce, 'catch the horse. In two days I\nshall be on board the Duncan, and in six at Twofold Bay. There is the\nplace of meeting. The lord's party will be still fast in the marshes\nof the Snowy. Cross the river at Kemple Pier bridge, go to the coast,\nand wait for me. I will find means to bring you on board. With the\ncrew once at sea, and a vessel like the Duncan, we shall be masters\nof the Indian Ocean.' 'Hurrah for Ben Joyce!' cried the convicts.\nMulready's horse was then led up, and Ben Joyce disappeared at a gallop\non the Lucknow road, while the band proceeded southeastward to the\nSnowy River. Mulready, although severely wounded, had strength to drag\nhimself within two hundred paces of the encampment, where we picked him\nup almost dead. This,\" added MacNabb, \"is Mulready's sad story. You\nunderstand now why the courageous sailor wished so much to speak.\"\n\nThis revelation terrified all.\n\n\"Pirates! pirates!\" cried Glenarvan. \"My crew massacred, my Duncan in\nthe hands of these bandits!\"\n\n\"Yes, for Ben Joyce will surprise the vessel,\" replied the major, \"and\nthen----\"\n\n\"Well, we must reach the coast before these wretches,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"But how cross the Snowy?\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"Like them,\" answered Glenarvan. \"They will cross Kemple Pier bridge,\nand we will do the same.\"\n\n\"But what will become of Mulready?\" inquired Lady Helena.\n\n\"We will take turns in carrying him. Shall I give up my defenceless\ncrew to Ben Joyce's band?\"\n\nThe plan of crossing Kemple Pier bridge was practicable, but perilous.\nThe convicts might locate themselves at this point to defend it. It\nwould be at least thirty against seven! But there are moments when we\ndo not think of these things, when we must advance at all hazards.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Captain Mangles, at length, \"before risking our\nlast chance, before venturing towards the bridge, it is prudent to\nreconnoitre it first. I will undertake this.\"\n\n\"I will accompany you, captain,\" replied Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: THE BURNED BRIDGE.]\n\nThis proposal was accepted, and the captain and Paganel prepared to\nstart immediately. They were to follow along the bank of the river till\nthey came to the place indicated by Ben Joyce, and keep out of sight\nof the convicts, who were probably lying in wait. These two courageous\nmen accordingly, well furnished with arms and provisions, set out, and\nsoon disappeared among the tall rushes of the river.\n\n[Illustration: The animal reared. Mulready seized his revolver and\nfired.]\n\nAll day the little party waited for them. At evening they had not yet\nreturned, and great fears were entertained. At last, about eleven\no'clock, Wilson announced their approach. They arrived, worn out with\nthe fatigues of a six-mile journey.\n\n\"The bridge? Is it there?\" asked Glenarvan, rushing to meet them.\n\n\"Yes, a bridge of rushes,\" said Captain Mangles. \"The convicts passed,\nit is true, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\" cried Glenarvan, who foresaw a new calamity.\n\n\"They burned it after their passage,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nHELPLESS AND HOPELESS.\n\n\nIt was not the time to despair, but to act. If Kemple Pier bridge was\ndestroyed, they must cross the Snowy at all events, and reach Twofold\nBay before Ben Joyce's band. They lost no time, therefore, in vain\nwords; but the next day Captain Mangles and Glenarvan went to examine\nthe river, preparatory to a passage.\n\nThe tumultuous waters, swollen by the rains, had not subsided. They\nwhirled along with indescribable fury. It was certain death to brave\nthis torrent. Glenarvan, with folded arms and lowered head, stood\nmotionless.\n\n\"Do you wish me to try to swim to the opposite bank?\" asked Captain\nMangles.\n\n\"No, John,\" replied Glenarvan, seizing the bold young man by the hand;\n\"let us wait.\"", "\"Do you wish me to try to swim to the opposite bank?\" asked Captain\nMangles.\n\n\"No, John,\" replied Glenarvan, seizing the bold young man by the hand;\n\"let us wait.\"\n\nThey both returned to the encampment. The day was passed in the most\nlively anxiety. Ten times did Glenarvan return to the river. He sought\nto contrive some bold plan of crossing it, but in vain. It would not\nhave been more impassable if a torrent of lava had flowed between its\nbanks.\n\nDuring these long hours of delay, Lady Helena, with the major's\nassistance, bestowed upon Mulready the most skillful care. The sailor\nfelt that he was returning to life. MacNabb ventured to affirm that no\nvital organ had been injured, the loss of blood sufficiently explained\nthe patient's weakness. Thus, as soon as his wound was healed and the\nhemorrhage stopped, only time and rest were needed for his complete\nrestoration. Lady Helena had insisted upon his occupying her end of the\ncart. Mulready felt greatly honored. His greatest anxiety was in the\nthought that his condition might delay Glenarvan, and he forced them to\npromise that they would leave him at the camp in charge of Wilson, as\nsoon as the river became fordable.\n\nUnfortunately, this was not possible, either that day or the next. At\nseeing himself thus detained, Glenarvan despaired. Lady Helena and the\nmajor tried in vain to pacify and exhort him to patience. Patience!\nwhen, at that moment perhaps, Ben Joyce was going on board the yacht,\nwhen the Duncan was weighing anchor and steaming towards that fatal\ncoast, to which every hour brought her nearer!\n\n[Sidenote: ALMOST DESPAIRING.]\n\nCaptain Mangles felt at heart all Glenarvan's anguish, and, as he\nwished to overcome the difficulty at all hazards, he constructed a\ncanoe in the Australian fashion, with large pieces of the bark of the\ngum-trees. These slabs, which were very light, were held together by\nwooden cross-bars, and formed a very frail craft.\n\nThe captain and the sailor tried the canoe. All that skill, strength,\nor courage could do they did. But scarcely were they in the current,\nwhen they capsized and narrowly escaped with their lives. The boat was\ndrawn into the eddies and disappeared. Captain Mangles and Wilson had\nnot advanced ten yards into the river, which was swollen by the rains\nand melting snows till it was now a mile in breadth.\n\nTwo days were wasted in this way. The major and Glenarvan went five\nmiles up stream without finding a practicable ford. Everywhere was the\nsame impetuosity, the same tumultuous rush of water; all the southern\nslopes of the mountains had poured their liquid torrents into this\nsingle stream. They were forced, therefore, to give up any hope of\nsaving the Duncan. Five days had passed since Ben Joyce's departure,\nthe yacht was probably that very moment at the coast, in the hands of\nthe convicts.\n\nHowever, this state of things could not last long. Indeed, on the\nmorning of the third day, Paganel perceived that the waters were\nbeginning to subside. He reported to Glenarvan the result of his\nobservations.\n\n\"What does it matter now?\" replied Glenarvan; \"it is too late!\"\n\n\"That is no reason for prolonging our stay at the encampment,\" replied\nthe major.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Captain Mangles; \"to-morrow, perhaps, it will be\npossible to cross.\"\n\n\"But will that save my unfortunate crew?\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Listen to me, my lord,\" continued Captain Mangles. \"I know Tom Austin.\nHe was to execute your orders, and start as soon as his departure was\npossible. Who knows whether the Duncan was ready, or her injuries\nrepaired, on the arrival of Ben Joyce at Melbourne? Supposing the\nyacht could not put to sea, and suffered one or two days of delay?\"\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied Glenarvan. \"We must reach Twofold Bay.\nWe are only thirty-five miles from Delegete.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Paganel, \"and in that town we shall find rapid means of\nconveyance. Who knows whether we shall not arrive in time to prevent\nthis calamity?\"\n\n\"Let us start!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nCaptain Mangles and Wilson at once occupied themselves in constructing\na raft of large dimensions. Experience had proved that pieces of bark\ncould not resist the violence of the torrent. The captain cut down\nseveral gum-trees, of which he made a rude but substantial raft. It was\na tedious task, and that day ended before the work was completed; but\nthe next day it was finished.\n\nThe waters had now considerably subsided. The torrent had become a\nriver again, with a rapid current. However, with proper management, the\ncaptain hoped to reach the opposite bank.\n\nAt noon they put on board as much provisions as each could carry for\ntwo days' travel. The rest was abandoned with the cart and the tent.\nMulready was well enough to be moved; he was recovering rapidly.\n\nEach took his place on the raft, which was moored to the bank. Captain\nMangles had arranged on the starboard side, and confided to Wilson, a\nkind of oar to sustain the raft against the current, and prevent its\ndrifting. As for himself, he stood at the stern, and steered by means\nof a clumsy rudder. Lady Helena and Mary Grant occupied the centre\nof the raft near Mulready. Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, and Robert\nsurrounded them, ready to lend assistance.\n\n\"Are we ready, Wilson?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied the sailor, seizing his oar with a firm hand.\n\n[Illustration: However, the raft was entangled in the midst of the\nriver, half a mile below where they started.]\n\n\"Attention, and bear up against the current.\"\n\nCaptain Mangles unmoored the raft, and with one push launched it into\nthe current of the river. All went well for some time, and Wilson\nresisted the leeway. But soon the craft was drawn into the eddies, and\nturned round and round, so that neither oar nor rudder could keep it in\na straight course. In spite of their efforts, they were soon placed in\na position where it was impossible to use the oars.\n\nThey were forced to be passive; there was no means of preventing this\ngyratory motion. They were whirled about with a giddy rapidity, and\nsent out of their course. The captain, with pale face and set teeth,\nstood and gazed at the eddying water.\n\nHowever, the raft was entangled in the midst of the river, half a mile\nbelow where they started. The current here was very strong, and, as\nit broke the eddies, it lessened the whirling motion. The captain and\nWilson resumed their oars, and succeeded in propelling the craft in an\noblique direction. In this way they approached nearer the left bank,\nand were only a few yards distant, when Wilson's oar broke. The raft,\nno longer sustained against the current, was carried down stream. The\ncaptain endeavored to prevent it, at the risk of breaking his rudder,\nand Wilson with bleeding hands assisted him.\n\nAt last they succeeded, and the raft, after a voyage of more than half\nan hour, ran upon the steeply-sloping bank. The shock was violent; the\ntimbers were thrown apart, the ropes broken, and the foaming water came\nthrough. The travelers had only time to cling to the bushes that hung\nover the stream. They extricated Mulready and the two ladies, who were\nhalf drenched. In short, everybody was saved; but the greater part of\nthe provisions and arms, except the major's rifle, were swept away with\nthe fragments of the raft.\n\n[Sidenote: A WEARY PILGRIMAGE.]\n\nThe river was crossed, but the little party were without resources,\nthirty-five miles from Delegete, in the midst of these untrodden\ndeserts. They resolved to start without delay. Mulready saw that he\nwould cause trouble, and desired to remain behind, even alone, and wait\nfor aid from Delegete. But Glenarvan refused. He could not reach the\ntown before three days. If the Duncan had left Melbourne several days\nbefore, what mattered a delay of a few hours?\n\n\"No, my friend,\" said he; \"I will not abandon any one. We will make a\nlitter, and take turns in carrying you.\"\n\nThe litter was made of branches covered with leaves, and upon this\nMulready was placed. Glenarvan wished to be the first to bear the\nsailor, and, seizing one end of the litter and Wilson the other, they\nstarted.\n\nWhat a sad sight! and how disastrously this journey, so well begun,\nhad ended! They were no longer going in search of Captain Grant.\nThis continent--where he was not, nor had ever been--threatened to\nbe fatal to those who were seeking traces of him, and perhaps new\ndiscouragements still awaited them.\n\nThe first day passed silently and painfully. Every ten minutes they\ntook turns in carrying the litter. All the sailor's companions\nuncomplainingly imposed upon themselves this duty, which was made still\nmore arduous by the great heat.\n\nAt evening, after accomplishing only five miles, they encamped under\na group of gum-trees. The rest of the provisions that had escaped the\nshipwreck furnished the evening meal. They must hereafter rely on the\nmajor's rifle; but he found no opportunity to fire a single shot.\nFortunately, Robert found a nest of bustards, containing a dozen large\neggs, which Olbinett cooked in the hot ashes. In addition to these\nembarrassments, their way became very difficult. The sandy plains were\nbristling with thorny plants that tore their garments and lacerated\ntheir limbs. The courageous ladies, however, did not complain, but\nvaliantly advanced, setting the example, and encouraging each other by\na word or a look.\n\nOn the third day Mulready traveled part of the way on foot. His wound\nhad entirely healed. The town of Delegete was only ten miles distant,\nand at evening they encamped on the very frontiers of New South Wales.", "A fine and penetrating rain had been falling for several hours, and\nall shelter would have failed, if Captain Mangles had not fortunately\ndiscovered a ruined and abandoned sawyer's hut. They were obliged to\ncontent themselves with this miserable hovel of branches and thatch.\nWilson attempted to kindle a fire to prepare the food, and accordingly\ncollected some dead wood that strewed the ground. But when he attempted\nto light the fuel he did not succeed; the great quantity of aluminous\nmaterial that it contained prevented combustion. It was, therefore,\nnecessary to dispense with fire and food, and sleep in wet garments,\nwhile the birds, hidden in the lofty branches, seemed to mock these\nunfortunate travelers.\n\nHowever, Glenarvan and his friends were approaching the end of their\nsufferings; and it was time. The two ladies exerted themselves\nheroically, but their strength was failing every hour. They dragged\nthemselves along, they no longer walked.\n\nThe next day they started at daybreak, and at eleven o'clock Delegete\ncame in sight, fifty miles from Twofold Bay. Here means of conveyance\nwere quickly obtained. Feeling himself so near the coast, hope returned\nto Glenarvan's heart; perhaps there had been some slight delay, and he\nwould arrive before the Duncan! In twenty-four hours he would reach the\nbay!\n\nAt noon, after a comforting repast, all the travelers took their seats\nin a mail-coach, and left Delegete at the full speed of five strong\nhorses. The postilions, stimulated by the promise of a large reward,\ndrove them along at a rapid rate, over a well-kept road. No time was\nlost in changing horses, and it seemed as if Glenarvan had inspired\nall with his own intense eagerness.\n\n[Illustration: The two ladies exerted themselves heroically, but their\nstrength was failing every hour. They dragged themselves along, they no\nlonger walked.]\n\nAll day and all night they traveled with the same swiftness, and at\nsunrise the next morning a low murmur announced the proximity of the\nIndian Ocean. It was necessary, however, to pass around the bay to gain\nthat part of the coast where Tom Austin was to meet the travelers.\n\nWhen the sea appeared, all eyes quickly surveyed the wide expanse. Was\nthe Duncan there, by a miracle of Providence, as she had been discerned\nbefore by some of them on the Argentine coast? Nothing was seen; sky\nand water mingled in an unbroken horizon; not a sail brightened the\nvast extent of ocean.\n\nOne hope still remained. Perhaps Tom Austin had thought it best to cast\nanchor in Twofold Bay, as the sea was rough and a vessel could not be\nmoored in safety near such shores.\n\n\"To Eden!\" said Glenarvan.\n\nThe mail-coach at once took the road to the right, which ran along the\nedge of the bay, and proceeded towards the little town of Eden, only\nfive miles distant. The postilions stopped not far from the light that\nguarded the entrance to the harbor. Several ships were anchored in the\nroadstead, but none displayed the flag of Malcolm Castle.\n\nGlenarvan, Captain Mangles, and Paganel alighted immediately, and\nhastened to the custom-house. Here they questioned the employees, and\nconsulted the latest arrivals. No vessel had entered the bay for a week.\n\n\"She may not have started!\" cried Glenarvan, who would not despair.\n\"Perhaps we have arrived before her!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles shook his head. He knew Tom Austin; his mate would\nnever have delayed so long to execute an order.\n\n\"I will know what this means,\" said Glenarvan. \"Certainty is better\nthan doubt.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST HOPE.]\n\nFifteen minutes later a telegram was sent to the ship-brokers of\nMelbourne, and the travelers repaired to the Victoria Hotel. Not long\nafter an answer was delivered to Lord Glenarvan. It read as follows:\n\n\"Lord Glenarvan,\n            Eden, Twofold Bay.\n\n\"Duncan started on the 18th instant for some unknown destination.\"\n\nThe dispatch fell from Glenarvan's hands. There was no more doubt! The\nhonest Scotch yacht, in Ben Joyce's hands, had become a pirate-vessel!\n\nThus ended their search in Australia, begun under such favorable\nauspices. The traces of Captain Grant and his shipwrecked sailors\nseemed irrecoverably lost. This failure had cost the lives of an entire\ncrew. Lord Glenarvan was crushed by the blow, and this courageous\nsearcher, whom the leagued elements had failed to deter, was now\nbaffled by the malice of men.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nA ROUGH CAPTAIN.\n\n\nIf ever the searchers for Captain Grant had reason to despair of seeing\nhim again, was it not when every hope forsook them at once? To what\npart of the world should they venture a new expedition? how explore\nunknown countries? The Duncan was no longer in their possession, and\nthey could not be immediately reconciled to their misfortune. The\nundertaking of these generous Scots had, therefore, failed. Failure!\nsad word, that finds no echo in a valiant soul; and yet, amid all\nthe changes of destiny, Glenarvan was forced to acknowledge his\npowerlessness to pursue this work of mercy.\n\nMary Grant, in this situation, no longer had the courage to utter the\nname of her father. She suppressed her own anguish by thinking of the\nunfortunate crew. Controlling herself in the presence of her friend, it\nwas she who consoled Lady Helena, from whom she had received so many\nconsolations. The young girl was the first to speak of their return to\nScotland. At seeing her so courageous and resigned, Captain Mangles\nadmired her, and would have spoken a final word in favor of Captain\nGrant, if Mary had not stopped him with a look and then said:\n\n\"No, Mr. John; let us think of those who have sacrificed themselves.\nLord Glenarvan must return to England.\"\n\n\"You are right, Miss Mary,\" replied he; \"he must. The English\nauthorities must also be informed of the fate of the Duncan. But do not\ngive up all hope. The search that we have begun I would continue alone,\nrather than abandon. I will find Captain Grant, or succumb to the task!\"\n\nThis was a solemn compact which John Mangles thus made. Mary accepted\nit, and gave her hand to the young captain, as if to ratify this\ntreaty. On the part of the latter it was a devotion of his entire life;\non the part of the former, an unchanging gratitude.\n\nThe time of their departure was now definitely decided. They resolved\nto proceed to Melbourne without delay. The next day Captain Mangles\nwent to inquire about vessels that were upon the point of sailing. He\nexpected to find frequent communication between Eden and Melbourne, but\nhe was disappointed. The vessels were few; two or three anchored in\nTwofold Bay composed the entire fleet of the place. There were none for\nMelbourne, Sydney, or Point-de-Galle.\n\nIn this state of affairs, what was to be done? Wait for a ship? They\nmight be delayed a long time, for Twofold Bay is little frequented.\nAfter some deliberation, Glenarvan was about to decide upon reaching\nSydney by the coast, when Paganel made a proposal that was unexpected\nto every one.\n\nThe geographer had just returned from Twofold Bay. He knew that there\nwere no means of transportation to Sydney or Melbourne; but, of the\nthree vessels anchored in the roadstead, one was preparing to start\nfor Auckland, the capital of Ika-na-Maoui, the northern island of New\nZealand. Thither Paganel proposed to go by the bark in question, and\nfrom Auckland it would be easy to return to England by the steamers of\nthe English company.\n\nThis proposition was taken into serious consideration, although Paganel\ndid not enter into those extended arguments of which he was usually so\nlavish. He confined himself to stating the fact, and added that the\nvoyage would not last more than five or six days.\n\nCaptain Mangles advocated Paganel's plan. He thought it should be\nadopted, since they could not wait for the uncertain arrival of other\nvessels. But, before deciding, he judged it advisable to visit the ship\nin question. Accordingly, he, with Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert, took a boat, and pulled out to where it was anchored.\n\nIt was a brig of two hundred and fifty tons, called the Macquarie,\nwhich traded between the different ports of Australia and New Zealand.\nThe captain, or rather the \"master,\" received his visitors very\ngruffly. They saw that they had to deal with an uneducated man, whose\nmanners were not different from those of the five sailors of his\ncrew. A coarse red face, big hands, a flat nose, a blinded eye, lips\nblackened by his pipe, and a specially brutish appearance, made Will\nHalley a very forbidding character. But they had no choice, and for a\nvoyage of a few days there was no need to be very particular.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Will Halley, as the strangers reached the\ndeck of his vessel.\n\n\"The captain,\" replied Mangles.\n\n[Sidenote: A BUSINESS INTERVIEW.]\n\n\"I am he,\" said Halley. \"What then?\"\n\n\"The Macquarie is loading for Auckland?\"\n\n\"Yes. What of it?\"\n\n\"What does she carry?\"\n\n\"Anything that is bought or sold.\"\n\n\"When does she sail?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, at the noon tide.\"\n\n\"Would she take passengers?\"\n\n\"That depends upon the passengers, and whether they would be satisfied\nwith the ship's mess.\"\n\n\"They would take their own provisions.\"\n\n\"Well, how many are there?\"\n\n\"Nine,--two of them ladies.\"\n\n\"I have no cabins.\"\n\n\"We will arrange a place for their exclusive use.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Do you accept?\" asked Captain Mangles, who was not embarrassed by this\ncurtness.\n\n\"I must see,\" replied the master of the Macquarie. He took a turn or\ntwo, striking the deck with his heavy, hobnailed boots; then, turning\nto Captain Mangles, said:\n\n\"What do you pay?\"\n\n\"What do you ask?\" was the reply.\n\n\"Fifty pounds.\"\n\nGlenarvan nodded assent.\n\n\"Very well! Fifty pounds.\"\n\n\"But the passage in cash!\" added Halley.\n\n\"In cash.\"\n\n\"Food separate?\"\n\n\"Separate.\"\n\n\"Agreed. Well?\" said Will Halley, holding out his hand.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The advance-money.\"\n\n\"Here is half the fare,--twenty-five pounds,\" said Captain Mangles,\ncounting out the sum, which the master pocketed without saying \"thank\nyou.\"", "\"What?\"\n\n\"The advance-money.\"\n\n\"Here is half the fare,--twenty-five pounds,\" said Captain Mangles,\ncounting out the sum, which the master pocketed without saying \"thank\nyou.\"\n\n\"Be on board to-morrow,\" said he. \"Whether you are here or not, I shall\nweigh anchor.\"\n\n\"We will be here.\"\n\nThereupon Glenarvan, the major, Robert, Paganel, and Captain Mangles\nleft the vessel, without Will Halley's having so much as touched the\nbrim of his hat.\n\n\"What a stupid fellow!\" was their first remark.\n\n\"Well, I like him,\" replied Paganel. \"He is a real sea-wolf.\"\n\n\"A real bear!\" remarked the major.\n\n\"And I imagine,\" added Captain Mangles, \"that this bear has at some\ntime traded in human flesh.\"\n\n\"What matter,\" replied Glenarvan, \"so long as he commands the\nMacquarie, which goes to New Zealand? We shall see very little of him\non the voyage.\"\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant were very much pleased to know that they\nwere to start the next day. Glenarvan observed, however, that the\nMacquarie could not equal the Duncan for comfort; but, after so many\nhardships, they were not likely to be overcome by trifles. Mr. Olbinett\nwas requested to take charge of the provisions. The poor man, since the\nloss of the Duncan, had often lamented the unhappy fate of his wife,\nwho had remained on board, and would be, consequently, the victim of\nthe convicts' brutality. However, he fulfilled his duties as steward\nwith his accustomed zeal, and their food might yet consist of dishes\nthat were never seen on the ship's table.\n\nIn the mean time the major discounted at a money-changer's some drafts\nthat Glenarvan had on the Union Bank of Melbourne. As for Paganel, he\nprocured an excellent map of New Zealand.\n\nMulready was now quite well. He scarcely felt his wound, which had so\nnearly proved fatal. A few hours at sea would complete his recovery.\n\n[Illustration: The landlord of Victoria Hotel furnished them with two\nhorses, and they set out.]\n\nWilson went on board first, charged with arranging the passengers'\nquarters. Under his vigorous use of the brush and broom the aspect\nof things was greatly changed. Will Halley shrugged his shoulders,\nbut allowed the sailor to do as he pleased. As for Glenarvan and his\nfriends, he scarcely noticed them; he did not even know their names,\nnor did he care to. This increase of cargo was worth fifty pounds to\nhim, but he valued it less than the two hundred tons of tanned leather\nwith which his hold was crowded,--the skins first, and the passengers\nnext. He was a real trader; and by his nautical ability he passed for a\ngood navigator of these seas, rendered so very dangerous by the coral\nreefs.\n\nDuring the afternoon, Glenarvan wished to visit once more the supposed\nplace of the shipwreck. Ayrton had certainly been the quartermaster of\nthe Britannia, and the vessel might really have been lost on that part\nof the coast. And there, at all events, the Duncan had fallen into the\nhands of the convicts. Had there been a fight? Perhaps they would find\non the beach traces of a struggle. If the crew had perished in the\nwaves, would not the bodies have been cast ashore?\n\nGlenarvan, accompanied by his faithful captain, undertook this\nexamination. The landlord of Victoria Hotel furnished them with two\nhorses, and they set out. But it was a sad journey. They rode in\nsilence. The same thoughts, the same anxieties, tortured the mind of\neach. They gazed at the rocks worn by the sea. They had no need to\nquestion or answer; no sign of the Duncan could be found,--the whole\ncoast was bare.\n\nCaptain Mangles, however, found on the margin of the shore evident\nsigns of an encampment, the remains of fires recently kindled beneath\nthe few trees. Had a wandering tribe of natives passed there within\na few days? No, for an object struck Glenarvan's eye, which proved\nincontestably that the convicts had visited that part of the coast.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT IN AUSTRALIA.]\n\nIt was a gray and yellow jacket, worn and patched, left at the foot\nof a tree. It bore a number and badge of the Perth penitentiary. The\nconvict was no longer there, but his cast-off garment betrayed him.\n\n\"You see, John,\" said Glenarvan, \"the convicts have been here! And our\npoor comrades of the Duncan----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the captain, in a low voice, \"they have certainly been\nlanded, and have perished!\"\n\n\"The wretches!\" cried Glenarvan. \"If they ever fall into my hands, I\nwill avenge my crew!\"\n\nGrief and exposure had hardened Glenarvan's features. For several\nmoments he gazed at the vast expanse of water, seeking perhaps to\ndiscern some ship in the dim distance. Then his eyes relaxed their\nfierceness, he regained his composure, and, without adding a word or\nmaking a sign, took the road to Eden.\n\nOnly one duty remained to be fulfilled,--to inform the constable of\nthe events that had just transpired, which was done the same evening.\nThe magistrate, Thomas Banks, could scarcely conceal his satisfaction\nat making out the official record. He was simply delighted at the\ndeparture of Ben Joyce and his band. The whole village shared his joy.\nThe convicts had left Australia because of a new crime; but, at all\nevents, they had gone. This important news was immediately telegraphed\nto the authorities of Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nHaving accomplished his object, Glenarvan returned to the Victoria\nHotel. The travelers passed this last evening in Australia in sadness.\nTheir thoughts wandered over this country, so fertile in misfortunes.\nThey recalled the hopes they had reasonably conceived at Cape\nBernouilli, now so cruelly disappointed at Twofold Bay.\n\nPaganel was a prey to a feverish agitation. Captain Mangles, who had\nwatched him since the incident at Snowy River, many times pressed him\nwith questions which Paganel did not answer. But that evening, as he\nwent with him to his chamber, the captain asked him why he was so\nnervous.\n\n\"My friend,\" replied Paganel evasively, \"I am no more nervous than\nusual.\"\n\n\"Mr. Paganel, you have a secret that troubles you.\"\n\n\"Well, as you will,\" cried the geographer; \"it is stronger than I.\"\n\n\"What is stronger than you?\"\n\n\"My joy on the one hand, and my despair on the other.\"\n\n\"You are joyful and despairing at the same time?\"\n\n\"Yes; joyful and despairing at visiting New Zealand.\"\n\n\"Have you any news?\" asked Captain Mangles. \"Have you discovered the\nlost trail?\"\n\n\"No, friend. _People never return from New Zealand!_ But yet--well, you\nknow human nature. As long as we breathe we can hope; and my motto is\n'_dum spiro, spero_,' which is the best in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nTHE WRECK OF THE MACQUARIE.\n\n\nThe next day the travelers were installed on board the Macquarie.\nWill Halley had not offered the ladies his cabin, which was not to be\nregretted, as the lair was only fit for the brute.\n\nAt noon they made ready to take the flood-tide. The anchor was weighed.\nA moderate breeze blew from the southwest. The sails were gradually\nset, but the five men worked slowly. At last, incited by the oaths\nof the skipper, they accomplished their task. But in spite of her\nspread of canvas the brig scarcely advanced. Yet, however poorly she\nsailed, in five or six days they hoped to reach the harbor of Auckland.\nAt seven o'clock in the evening they lost sight of the shores of\nAustralia, and the lighthouse at Eden. The sea was rough, and the\nvessel labored heavily in the trough of the waves. The passengers found\ntheir situation very uncomfortable; but, as they could not remain on\ndeck, they were forced to submit to confinement.\n\n[Illustration: But on the next day seven canoes of the islanders\nattacked it most violently and suddenly, causing it to capsize.]\n\nThat evening conversation very naturally turned upon the land to which\nthey were now sailing, its discovery and colonization; and just as\nnaturally all turned to Paganel as to a bookcase, for some information\nthereon. It was very readily accessible, although evidently to the\ngeographer's mind there was something of a painful character connected\nwith the name, the impression, and the very thoughts of New Zealand and\nits Maori inhabitants.\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel,\" said Lady Helena, \"have your friends, the English,\nbeen the only ones to search out this island?\"\n\n\"By no means, madam,\" was the prompt reply. \"On the contrary, they\nhave come second, nay, third, in the race; only,\" and he looked half\nroguishly and half maliciously, \"_they stayed when they came_.\"\n\nAnd then he told them of its first discovery by Abel Tasman, the Dutch\nnavigator, in 1642; that, when first he landed, there seemed to be\namicable feelings expressed by the islanders toward himself, a number\nof them coming back to his ship, and being apparently well pleased to\ncultivate intercourse. But on the next day, as he sent his boat to\nfind good anchorage nearer to the shore, seven canoes of the islanders\nattacked it most violently and suddenly, causing it to capsize, and so\nvigorously assailing its occupants with their pikes that it was with\ndifficulty any of them were able to swim back to their ship, leaving\nthose of their companions who were not drowned to be butchered by the\nnatives.\n\n[Sidenote: A SADDENING HISTORY.]", "[Sidenote: A SADDENING HISTORY.]\n\nOf course he did not forget to mention that a French navigator,\nSurville by name, was the next to visit the shores, and that his\nvisit likewise was the cause of bloodshed and misery. But he gave\nthem a more lengthy and extended narrative of Captain Cook's voyages,\nwhich were the most important in their results as well as the most\ninteresting and tragic in many of their incidents. It was on the 6th\nof October, 1769, that this navigator first landed on the shores which\nhe visited twice afterwards, and each time added greatly to the stock\nof previous knowledge concerning these islands, their productions, and\ntheir inhabitants. By him it was first ascertained that cannibalism was\npracticed by some, if not all, of the tribes at that time; and it was\nvery evident, from the manner of Paganel's narration, that hereabout\nlay the extremely sensitive point of the worthy geographer's fears and\nforebodings. However, he was not deterred from rehearsing how one and\nanother not merely visited, but began to settle, on the island, so that\nin the treaty of 1814 it was formally recognized as belonging to Great\nBritain, and twenty years after was important enough to have a separate\nofficial and governmental establishment.\n\nPaganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding.\n\n[Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.]\n\nFor a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well.\nThe French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel.\n\n[Illustration: Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the\nchief.]\n\nAll this and much more did the geographer narrate; but it must be\nconfessed that he neither spoke, nor did they listen, with the\ncomplacency evinced in his previous tales. Besides, their surroundings\nwere at the time uncomfortable, and the first prognostications of a\nspeedy passage were not likely to be verified.\n\nUnfortunately, this painful voyage was prolonged. Six days after her\ndeparture, the Macquarie had not descried the shores of Auckland.\nThe wind was fair, however, and still blew from the southwest; but\nnevertheless the brig did not make much headway. The sea was rough, the\nrigging creaked, the ribs cracked, and the vessel rode the waves with\ndifficulty.\n\nFortunately, Will Halley, like a man who was in no hurry, did not crowd\non sail, or his masts would inevitably have snapped. Captain Mangles\nhoped, therefore, that this clumsy craft would reach its destination\nin safety; still, he was pained to see his companions on board in such\nmiserable quarters.\n\n[Sidenote: PERSISTENT GRIEF.]\n\nBut neither Lady Helena nor Mary Grant complained, although the\ncontinual rain kept them confined, and the want of air and rolling of\nthe ship seriously incommoded them. Their friends sought to divert\nthem, and Paganel strove to while the time with his stories, but did\nnot succeed so well as previously.\n\nOf all the passengers, the one most to be pitied was Lord Glenarvan.\nThey rarely saw him below; he could not keep still. His nervous and\nexcitable nature would not submit to an imprisonment between four\nwooden walls. Day and night, heedless of the torrents of rain and the\ndashing spray of the sea, he remained on deck, sometimes bending over\nthe rail, sometimes pacing up and down with feverish agitation. His\neyes gazed continually into space, and, during the brief lulls, his\nglass persistently surveyed the horizon. He seemed to question the mute\nwaves; the mist that veiled the sky, the masses of vapor, he would have\npenetrated with a glance; he could not be resigned, and his countenance\nbetokened an acute grief. The power and hopefulness of this man,\nhitherto so energetic and courageous, had suddenly failed.\n\nCaptain Mangles seldom left him, but at his side endured the severity\nof the storm. That day, Glenarvan, wherever there was an opening in\nthe mist, scanned the horizon with the utmost persistency. The young\ncaptain approached him.\n\n\"Is your lordship looking for land?\" he asked.\n\nGlenarvan shook his head.\n\n\"It will yet be some time before we leave the brig. We ought to have\nsighted Auckland light thirty-six hours ago.\"\n\nGlenarvan did not answer. He still gazed, and for a moment his glass\nwas pointed towards the horizon to windward of the vessel.\n\n\"The land is not on that side,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Your lordship\nshould look towards the starboard.\"\n\n\"Why, John?\" replied Glenarvan. \"It is not the land that I am seeking.\"\n\n\"What is it, my lord?\"\n\n[Sidenote: A COURAGEOUS CAPTAIN.]\n\n\"My yacht, my Duncan! She must be here, in these regions, plowing\nthese seas, in that dreadful employment of a pirate. She is here, I\ntell you, John, on this course between Australia and New Zealand! I\nhave a presentiment that we shall meet her!\"\n\n[Illustration: Day and night, heedless of the torrents of rain and the\ndashing spray of the sea, he remained on deck.]\n\n\"God preserve us from such a meeting, my lord!\"\n\n\"Why, John?\"\n\n\"Your lordship forgets our situation. What could we do on this brig, if\nthe Duncan should give us chase? We could not escape.\"\n\n\"Escape, John?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord. We should try in vain. We should be captured, at the\nmercy of the wretches. Ben Joyce has shown that he does not hesitate at\na crime. I should sell my life dearly. We would defend ourselves to the\nlast extremity. Well! But, then, think of Lady Helena and Mary Grant!\"\n\n\"Poor women!\" murmured Glenarvan. \"John, my heart is broken, and\nsometimes I feel as if despair had invaded it. It seems to me as if\nnew calamities awaited us, as if Heaven had decreed against us! I am\nafraid!\"\n\n\"You, my lord?\"\n\n\"Not for myself, John, but for those whom I love, and whom you love\nalso.\"\n\n\"Take courage, my lord,\" replied the young captain. \"We need no longer\nfear. The Macquarie is a poor sailer, but still she sails. Will Halley\nis a brutish creature; but I am here, and if the approach to the land\nseems to me dangerous I shall take the ship to sea again. Therefore\nfrom this quarter there is little or no danger. But as for meeting the\nDuncan, God preserve us, and enable us to escape!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles was right. To encounter the Duncan would be fatal to\nthe Macquarie, and this misfortune was to be feared in these retired\nseas, where pirates could roam without danger. However, that day, at\nleast, the Duncan did not appear, and the sixth night since their\ndeparture from Twofold Bay arrived without Captain Mangles's fears\nbeing realized.\n\nBut that night was destined to be one of terror. Darkness set in almost\ninstantaneously towards evening; the sky was very threatening. Even\nWill Halley, whose sense of danger was superior to the brutishness of\nintoxication, was startled by these warning signs. He left his cabin,\nrubbing his eyes and shaking his great red head. Then he drew a long\nbreath, and examined the masts. The wind was fresh, and was blowing\nstrong towards the New Zealand coast.\n\nCaptain Halley summoned his men, with many oaths, and ordered them to\nreef the top-sails. Captain Mangles approved in silence. He had given\nup remonstrating with this coarse seaman; but neither he nor Glenarvan\nleft the deck.\n\nTwo hours passed. The sea grew more tempestuous, and the vessel\nreceived such severe shocks that it seemed as if her keel were grating\non the sand. There was no unusual roughness, but yet this clumsy craft\nlabored heavily, and the deck was deluged by the huge waves. The boat\nthat hung in the larboard davits was swept overboard by a rising billow.\n\nCaptain Mangles could not help being anxious. Any other vessel would\nhave mocked these surges; but with this heavy hulk they might well fear\nfoundering, for the deck was flooded with every plunge, and the masses\nof water, not finding sufficient outlet by the scuppers, might submerge\nthe ship. It would have been wise, as a preparation for any emergency,\nto cut away the waistcloth to facilitate the egress of the water; but\nWill Halley refused to take this precaution.\n\n[Sidenote: A NAUTICAL COUP D'ETAT.]\n\nHowever, a greater danger threatened the Macquarie, and probably there\nwas no longer time to prevent it. About half-past eleven Captain\nMangles and Wilson, who were standing on the leeward side, were\nstartled by an unusual sound. Their nautical instincts were roused,\nand the captain seized the sailor's hand.\n\n\"The surf!\" said he.", "\"The surf!\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Wilson. \"The sea is breaking on the reefs.\"\n\n\"Not more than two cable-lengths distant.\"\n\n\"Not more! The shore is here!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles leaned over the railing, gazed at the dark waves, and\ncried:\n\n\"The sounding-lead, Wilson!\"\n\nThe skipper, who was in the forecastle, did not seem to suspect his\nsituation. Wilson grasped the sounding-line, which lay coiled in its\npail, and rushed into the port-shrouds. He cast the lead; the rope\nslipped between his fingers; at the third knot it stopped.\n\n\"Three fathoms!\" cried Wilson.\n\n\"We are on the breakers!\" shouted the sober captain to the stupefied\none.\n\nWhether the former saw Halley shrug his shoulders or not is of little\nconsequence. At all events, he rushed towards the wheel and crowded\nthe helm hard alee, while Wilson, letting go the line, hauled upon the\ntop-sail yard-arms to luff the ship. The sailor who was steering, and\nhad been forcibly pushed aside, did not at all understand this sudden\nattack.\n\n\"To the port-yards! let loose the sails!\" cried the young captain,\nmanaging so as to escape the reefs.\n\nFor half a minute, the starboard side of the brig grazed the rocks,\nand, in spite of the darkness, John perceived a roaring line of\nbreakers that foamed a few yards from the ship.\n\n[Sidenote: VERY CRITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES.]\n\nAt this moment Will Halley, becoming conscious of the imminent danger,\nlost his presence of mind. His sailors, who were scarcely sober,\ncould not comprehend his orders. Moreover, his incoherent words and\ncontradictory commands showed that this stupid drunkard's coolness\nhad failed. He was surprised by the nearness of the land, which was\nonly eight miles off, when he thought it thirty or forty. The currents\nhad taken him unawares, and thrown him out of his ordinary course.\n\n[Illustration: The sailor who was steering, and had been forcibly\npushed aside, did not at all understand this sudden attack.]\n\nHowever, Captain Mangles's prompt management had rescued the brig from\nher peril; but he did not know his position. Perhaps he was inclosed by\na chain of reefs. The wind blew fresh from the east, and at every pitch\nthey might strike bottom.\n\nThe roar of the surf was soon redoubled, and it was necessary to luff\nstill more. John crowded the helm down and braced farther to leeward.\nThe breakers multiplied beneath the prow of the ship, and they were\nobliged to tack so as to put to sea. Would this manoeuvre succeed with\nsuch an unsteady vessel, and under such reduced sail? It was uncertain,\nbut as their only chance they must venture it.\n\n\"Hard alee!\" cried Captain Mangles to Wilson.\n\nThe Macquarie began to approach the new line of reefs. Soon the\nwater foamed above the submerged rocks. It was a moment of torturing\nsuspense. The spray glittered on the crests of the waves. You would\nhave thought a phosphorescent glow had suddenly illumined the water.\nWilson and Mulready forced down the wheel with their whole weight.\n\nSuddenly a shock was felt. The vessel had struck upon a rock. The\nbob-stays broke, and nearly overthrew the mainmast. Could they come\nabout without any other injury? No; for all at once there was a calm,\nand the ship veered to windward again, and her movements suddenly\nceased. A lofty wave seized and bore her forward towards the reefs,\nwhile she rolled heavily. The mainmast went by the board with all its\nrigging, the brig heaved twice and was motionless, leaning over to\nstarboard. The pump-lights were shattered in pieces, and the passengers\nrushed to the deck; but the waves were sweeping it from one end to\nthe other, and they could not remain without danger. Captain Mangles,\nknowing that the ship was firmly imbedded in the sand, besought them\nfor their own sakes to go below again.\n\n\"The truth, John?\" asked Glenarvan, faintly.\n\n\"The truth, my lord, is that we shall not founder. As for being\ndestroyed by the sea, that is another question; but we have time to\ntake counsel.\"\n\n\"Is it midnight?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord, and we must wait for daylight.\"\n\n\"Can we not put to sea in the boat?\"\n\n\"In this storm and darkness it is impossible. And, moreover, where\nshould we strike land?\"\n\n\"Well, John, let us remain here till morning.\"\n\nMeantime Will Halley was running about the deck like a madman. His\nsailors, who had recovered from their stupor, stove in a brandy-barrel\nand began to drink. Mangles foresaw that their drunkenness would lead\nto terrible scenes. The captain could not be relied upon to restrain\nthem; the miserable man tore his hair and wrung his hands; he thought\nonly of his cargo, which was not insured.\n\n\"I am ruined! I am lost!\" cried he, running to and fro.\n\nCaptain Mangles scarcely thought of consoling him. He armed his\ncompanions, and all stood ready to repel the sailors, who were filling\nthemselves with brandy, and cursing frightfully.\n\n\"The first of these wretches who approaches,\" said the major calmly, \"I\nwill shoot like a dog.\"\n\nThe sailors doubtless saw that the passengers were determined to keep\nthem at bay, for, after a few attempts at plunder, they disappeared.\nCaptain Mangles paid no more attention to these drunken men, but waited\nimpatiently for day.\n\n[Sidenote: SLEEPING IN A SAND-CRADLE.]\n\nThe ship was now absolutely immovable. The sea grew gradually calm,\nand the wind subsided. The hull could, therefore, hold out a few hours\nlonger. At sunrise they would examine the shore. If it seemed easy to\nland, the yawl, now the only boat on board, would serve to transport\nthe crew and passengers. It would require three trips, at least, to\naccomplish this, for there was room for only four persons. As for the\ngig, it had been swept overboard, during the storm, as before mentioned.\n\nWhile reflecting on the dangers of his situation, the young captain,\nleaning against the binnacle, listened to the roar of the surf. He\nstrove to pierce the dense darkness, and estimate how far he was from\nthat desired yet dreaded coast. Breakers are frequently heard several\nleagues at sea. Could the frail cutter weather so long a voyage in her\npresent shattered state?\n\nWhile he was thinking thus, and longing for a little light in the\ngloomy sky, the ladies, relying upon his words, were reposing in their\nberths. The steadiness of the brig secured them several hours of rest.\nGlenarvan and the others, no longer hearing the cries of the drunken\ncrew, refreshed themselves also by a hasty sleep, and, early in the\nmorning, deep silence reigned on board this vessel, which had sunk to\nrest, as it were, upon her bed of sand.\n\nAbout four o'clock the first light appeared in the east. The clouds\nwere delicately tinged by the pale rays of the dawn. Captain Mangles\ncame on deck. Along the horizon extended a curtain of mist. A few\nvague outlines floated in the vapors of the morning. A gentle swell\nstill agitated the sea, and the outer waves were lost in the dense,\nmotionless fog.\n\nHe waited. The light gradually brightened, and the horizon glowed with\ncrimson hues. The misty curtain gradually enveloped the vast vault of\nthe firmament. Black rocks emerged from the water. Then, a line was\ndefined along a border of foam, and a luminous point kindled like a\nlighthouse at the summit of a peak against the still invisible disk of\nthe rising sun.\n\n\"Land!\" cried Captain Mangles.\n\n[Illustration: The mainmast went by the board with all its rigging, the\nbrig heaved twice and was motionless, leaning over to starboard.]\n\n[Illustration: As the Macquarie lay over on her starboard beams, her\nopposite side was raised, and the defective seams were out of water.]\n\nHis companions, awakened by his voice, rushed on deck, and gazed in\nsilence at the coast that was seen on the horizon. Whether hospitable\nor fatal, it was to be their place of refuge.\n\n\"Where is that Halley?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I do not know, my lord,\" replied Captain Mangles.\n\n\"And his sailors?\"\n\n\"Disappeared, like himself.\"\n\n\"And like himself, doubtless, drunk,\" added MacNabb.\n\n\"Let us search for them,\" said Glenarvan; \"we cannot abandon them on\nthis vessel.\"\n\nMulready and Wilson went down to the bunks in the forecastle. The place\nwas empty. They then visited between-decks, and the hold, but found\nneither Halley nor his sailors.\n\n\"What! nobody?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Have they fallen into the sea?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"Anything is possible,\" replied Captain Mangles, who cared little for\ntheir disappearance.\n\nThen, turning towards the stern, he said,--\n\n\"To the boat!\"\n\nWilson and Mulready followed, to assist in lowering it.\n\nThe yawl was gone!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nVAIN EFFORTS.\n\n\nWill Halley and his crew, taking advantage of the night and the\npassengers' sleep, had fled with the only boat left. They could not\ndoubt it. This captain, who was in duty bound to be the last on board,\nhad been the first to leave.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ADVANTAGEOUS LOSS.]\n\n\"The rascals have fled,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Well, so much the\nbetter, my lord. We are spared so many disagreeable scenes.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Besides, there is a better\ncaptain on board, yourself, and courageous seamen, your companions.\nCommand us; we are ready to obey you.\"\n\nAll endorsed Glenarvan's words, and, ranged along the deck, they stood\nready for the young captain's orders.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\nJohn cast a glance over the ocean, looked at the shattered masts of the\nbrig, and, after a few moments' reflection, said:\n\n\"We have two ways, my lord, of extricating ourselves from this\nsituation: either to raise the vessel and put her to sea, or reach the\ncoast on a raft, which can be easily constructed.\"\n\n\"If the vessel can be raised, let us raise it,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\"That is the best plan, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; for, once ashore, what would become of us without means\nof transport?\"\n\n\"Let us avoid the coast,\" added Paganel. \"We must beware of New\nZealand.\"", "\"Yes, my lord; for, once ashore, what would become of us without means\nof transport?\"\n\n\"Let us avoid the coast,\" added Paganel. \"We must beware of New\nZealand.\"\n\n\"All the more so, as we have gone considerably astray,\" continued\nCaptain Mangles. \"Halley's carelessness has carried us to the south,\nthat is evident. At noon I will take an observation; and if, as I\npresume, we are below Auckland, I will try to sail the Macquarie up\nalong the coast.\"\n\n\"But the injuries of the brig?\" inquired Lady Helena.\n\n\"I do not think they are serious, madam,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"I\nshall rig a jury-mast at the bows; and we shall sail slowly, it is\ntrue, but still we shall go where we wish. If, unfortunately, the hull\nis stove in, or if the ship cannot be extricated, we must gain the\ncoast, and travel by land to Auckland.\"\n\n\"Let us examine the state of the vessel, then,\" said the major. \"This\nis of the first importance.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the captain, and Mulready opened the main scuttle, and went\ndown into the hold. About two hundred tons of tanned hides were there,\nvery badly stowed away; but they could draw them aside without much\ndifficulty, by means of the main-stay tackling, and they at once threw\noverboard part of this ballast so as to lighten the ship.\n\nAfter three hours of hard labor, they could see the bottom timbers. Two\nseams in the larboard planking had sprung open as far up as the channel\nwales. As the Macquarie lay over on her starboard beams, her opposite\nside was raised, and the defective seams were out of water. Wilson\nhastened, therefore, to tighten the joints with oakum, over which he\ncarefully nailed a copper plate. On sounding they found less than two\nfeet of water in the hold, which the pumps could easily exhaust, and\nthus relieve the ship. After his examination of the hull, the captain\nperceived that it had been little injured in stranding. It was probable\nthat a part of the false keel would remain in the sand, but they could\npass over it.\n\nWilson, after inspecting the interior of the brig, dived, in order to\ndetermine her position on the reef. The Macquarie was turned towards\nthe northwest, and lay on a very shelving, slimy sand-bar. The lower\nend of her prow and two-thirds of her keel were deeply imbedded in\nthe sand. The rest, as far as the stern, floated where the water was\nfive fathoms deep. The rudder was not, therefore, confined, but worked\nfreely. The captain considered it useless to lighten her, as he hoped\nthey would be ready to make use of her at the earliest opportunity.\nThe tides of the Pacific are not very strong, but he relied upon their\ninfluence to float the brig, which had stranded an hour before high\nwater. The only point was to extricate her, which would be a long and\npainful task.\n\n[Sidenote: LABOR FOR THE COMMON WEAL.]\n\n\"To work!\" cried the captain.\n\nHis improvised sailors were ready. He ordered them to reef the sails.\nThe major, Robert, and Paganel, under Wilson's direction, climbed\nthe maintop. The top-sail, swelled by the wind, would have prevented\nthe extrication of the ship, and it was necessary to reef it, which\nwas done as well as possible. At last, after much labor, severe to\nunaccustomed hands, the maintop-gallant was taken down. Young Robert,\nnimble as a cat, and bold as a cabin-boy, had rendered important\nservices in this difficult operation.\n\nIt was now advisable to cast one anchor, perhaps two, at the stern of\nthe vessel in the line of the keel. The effect of this would be to\nhaul the Macquarie around into deep water. There is no difficulty in\ndoing this when you have a boat, but here all the boats were gone, and\nsomething else must be supplied.\n\nGlenarvan was familiar enough with the sea to understand the necessity\nof these arrangements. One anchor was to be cast to prevent the ship\nfrom stranding at low water.\n\n\"But what shall we do without a boat?\" asked he of the captain.\n\n\"We will use the remains of the mizen-mast and the empty casks,\" was\nthe reply. \"It will be a difficult, but not impossible task, for the\nMacquarie's anchors are small. Once cast however, if they do not drag,\nI shall be encouraged.\"\n\n\"Very well, let us lose no time.\"\n\nTo accomplish their object, all were summoned on deck; each took\npart in the work. The rigging that still confined the mizen-mast was\ncut away, so that the maintop could be easily withdrawn. Out of this\nplatform Captain Mangles designed to make a raft. He supported it by\nmeans of empty casks, and rendered it capable of carrying the anchors.\nA rudder was fastened to it, which enabled them to steer the concern.\n\nThis labor was half accomplished when the sun neared the meridian.\nThe captain left Glenarvan to follow out his instructions, and turned\nhis attention to determining his position, which was very important.\nFortunately, he had found in Will Halley's cabin a Nautical Almanac and\na sextant, with which he was able to take an observation. By consulting\nthe map Paganel had bought at Eden, he saw that they had been wrecked\nat the mouth of Aotea Bay, above Cahua Point, on the shores of the\nprovince of Auckland. As the city was on the thirty-seventh parallel,\nthe Macquarie had been carried a considerable distance out of her\ncourse. It was, therefore, necessary to sail northward to reach the\ncapital of New Zealand.\n\n\"A journey of not more than twenty-five miles,\" said Glenarvan. \"It is\nnothing.\"\n\n\"What is nothing at sea will be long and difficult on land,\" replied\nPaganel.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Captain Mangles, \"let us do all in our power to\nfloat the Macquarie.\"\n\nThis question being settled, their labors were resumed. It was high\nwater, but they could not take advantage of it, since the anchors were\nnot yet moored. Yet the captain watched the ship with some anxiety.\nWould she float with the tide? This point would soon be decided.\n\nThey waited. Several cracks were heard, caused either by a rising or\nstarting of the keel. Great reliance had been placed upon the tide, but\nthe brig did not stir.\n\nThe work was continued, and the raft was soon ready. The small anchor\nwas put on board, and the captain and Wilson embarked, after mooring\na small cable at the stern. The ebb-tide made them drift, and they\ntherefore anchored, half a cable's length distant, in ten fathoms of\nwater. The bottom afforded a firm hold.\n\n[Sidenote: A MIDNIGHT CONCLAVE.]\n\nThe great anchor now remained. They lowered it with difficulty,\ntransported it on the raft, and soon it was moored behind the other;\nthe captain and his men returning to the vessel, and waiting for high\nwater, which would be early in the morning. It was now six o'clock\nin the evening. The young captain complimented his sailors, and told\nPaganel that, with the aid of courage and good discipline, he might one\nday become quartermaster.\n\nMeantime, Mr. Olbinett, after assisting in different operations, had\nreturned to the kitchen, and prepared a very comforting and seasonable\nrepast. The crew were tempted by a keen appetite, which was abundantly\nsatisfied, and each felt himself invigorated for fresh exertions.\n\nAfter dinner, Captain Mangles took a final precaution to insure the\nsuccess of his experiment. He threw overboard a great part of the\nmerchandise to lighten the brig; but the remainder of the ballast, the\nheavy spars, the spare yards, and a few tons of pig-iron, were carried\nto the stern, to aid by their weight in liberating the keel. Wilson and\nMulready likewise rolled to the same place a number of casks filled\nwith water. Midnight arrived before these labors were completed.\n\nBut at this hour the breeze subsided, and only a few capricious\nripples stirred the surface of the water. Looking towards the horizon,\nthe captain observed that the wind was changing from southwest to\nnorthwest. A sailor could not be mistaken in the peculiar arrangement\nand color of the clouds. He accordingly informed Glenarvan of these\nindications, and proposed to defer their work till the next day.\n\n[Sidenote: \"A TIDE IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN.\"]\n\n\"And these are my reasons,\" said he. \"First, we are very much fatigued,\nand all our strength is necessary to free the vessel. Then, when this\nis accomplished, how can we sail among the dangerous breakers, and\nin such profound darkness? Moreover, another reason induces me to\nwait. The wind promises to aid us, and I desire to profit by it, and\nam in hopes that it will drift the old hull out when the tide raises\nher. To-morrow, if I am not mistaken, the breeze will blow from the\nnorthwest. We will set the main-sails, and they will help to raise\nthe brig.\"\n\n[Illustration: They therefore anchored, half a cable's length distant,\nin ten fathoms of water.]\n\n\nThese reasons were decisive. Glenarvan and Paganel, the most impatient\non board, yielded, and the work was suspended.\n\nThe night passed favorably, and day appeared. Their captain's\npredictions were realized. The wind blew from the northwest, and\ncontinued to freshen. The crew were summoned. It was nine o'clock. Four\nhours were still to elapse before it would be high water, and that time\nwas not lost. The laborers renewed their efforts with very good success.\n\nMeantime the tide rose. The surface of the sea was agitated into\nripples, and the points of the rocks gradually disappeared, like\nmarine animals returning to their native element. The time for the\nfinal attempt approached. A feverish impatience thrilled all minds.\nNo one spoke. Each gazed at the captain, and awaited his orders. He\nwas leaning over the stern-railing, watching the water, and casting an\nuneasy glance towards the cables.\n\nAt last the tide reached its height. The experiment must now be made\nwithout delay. The main-sails were set, and the mast was bent with the\nforce of the wind.\n\n\"To the windlass!\" cried the captain.\n\nGlenarvan, Mulready, and Robert on one side, and Paganel, the major,\nand Olbinett on the other, bore down upon the handles that moved the\nmachine. At the same time the captain and Wilson added their efforts to\nthose of their companions.", "\"Down! down!\" cried the young captain; \"all together!\"\n\nThe cables were stretched taut under the powerful action of the\nwindlass. The anchors held fast, and did not drag. But they must be\nquick, for high tide lasts only a few moments, and the water would not\nbe long in lowering.\n\nThey redoubled their efforts. The wind blew violently, and forced the\nsails against the mast. A few tremors were felt in the hull, and the\nbrig seemed on the point of rising. Perhaps a little more power would\nsuffice to draw her from the sand.\n\n\"Helena! Mary!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThe two ladies came and joined their efforts to those of their\ncompanions. A final crack was heard, but that was all! The experiment\nhad failed. The tide was already beginning to ebb, and it was evident\nthat, even with the aid of wind and tide, this insufficient crew could\nnot float their ship.\n\nAs their first plan had failed, it was necessary to have recourse to\nthe second without delay. It was plain that they could not raise the\nMacquarie, and that the only way was to abandon her. To wait on board\nfor the uncertain arrival of assistance would have been folly and\nmadness.\n\nThe captain therefore proposed to construct a raft strong enough to\nconvey the passengers and a sufficient quantity of provisions to the\nNew Zealand coast. It was not a time for discussion, but for action.\nThe work was accordingly begun, and considerably advanced when night\ninterrupted them.\n\nIn the evening, after supper, while Lady Helena and Mary Grant were\nreposing in their berths, Paganel and his friends conversed seriously\nas they paced the deck. The geographer had asked Captain Mangles\nwhether the raft could not follow the coast as far as Auckland, instead\nof landing the passengers at once. The captain replied that it would be\nimpossible with such a rude craft.\n\n\"And could we have done with the boat what we cannot do with the raft?\"\n\n\"Yes, candidly speaking, we could,\" was the reply; \"but with the\nnecessity of sailing by day and anchoring by night.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A FRENCHMAN'S FOIBLE.]\n\n\"Then these wretches, who have abandoned us----\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Captain Mangles, \"they were drunk, and in the profound\ndarkness I fear they have paid for their cowardly desertion with their\nlives.\"\n\n\"So much the worse for them,\" continued Paganel; \"and for us, too, as\nthis boat would have been useful.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Paganel?\" said Glenarvan. \"The raft will take us\nashore.\"\n\n\"That is precisely what I would avoid,\" replied the geographer.\n\n\"What! can a journey of not more than twenty miles terrify us, after\nwhat has been done on the Pampas and in Australia?\"\n\n\"My friends,\" resumed Paganel, \"I do not doubt your courage, nor that\nof our fair companions. Twenty miles is nothing in any other country\nexcept New Zealand. Here, however, anything is better than venturing\nupon these treacherous shores.\"\n\n\"Anything is better than exposing yourself to certain death on a\nwrecked vessel,\" returned Captain Mangles.\n\n\"What have we to fear in New Zealand?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"The savages!\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"The savages?\" said Glenarvan. \"Can we not avoid them by following the\ncoast? Besides, an attack from a few wretches cannot intimidate ten\nwell-armed and determined Europeans.\"\n\n\"It is not a question of wretches,\" rejoined Paganel. \"The New\nZealanders form terrible tribes that struggle against the English\ngovernment, fight with invaders, frequently conquer them, and always\neat them.\"\n\n\"Cannibals! cannibals!\" cried Robert; and then he murmured, as though\nafraid to give full utterance to the words, \"My sister! Lady Helena!\"\n\n\"Never fear, my boy!\" said Glenarvan; \"our friend Paganel exaggerates.\"\n\n[Illustration: The work was accordingly begun, and considerably\nadvanced when night interrupted them.]\n\n[Illustration: Not long since, in the year 1864, one of these clergymen\nwas seized by the chiefs and hung from the tree.]\n\n\"I do not exaggerate,\" replied Paganel. \"With these New Zealanders war\nis what the sports of the chase are to civilized nations; and the game\nthey hunt for they feast upon.\"\n\n\"Paganel,\" said the major, \"this may be all very true, but have you\nforgotten the introduction of Christianity? has it not destroyed these\nanthropophagous habits?\"\n\n\"No, it has not,\" was the prompt reply. \"The records are yet fresh of\nministers who have gone out to proclaim Christianity and have fallen\nvictims to the murderous and cannibal instincts of those to whom they\npreached. Not long since, in the year 1864, one of these clergymen\nwas seized by the chiefs, was hung to the tree, was tantalized and\ntortured to his last moments; and then, whilst some tore his body to\npieces, others devoured the various members. No, the Maoris are still\ncannibals, and will remain so for some time to come.\"\n\nBut Paganel was on this point a pessimist, contrary to his usual\ncharacteristic.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nA DREADED COUNTRY.\n\n\nWhat Paganel had stated was indisputable. The cruelty of the New\nZealanders could not be doubted. There was, therefore, danger in\nlanding. But if the danger had been a hundred times greater, it must\nhave been faced. Captain Mangles felt the necessity of leaving this\nvessel, which would soon break up. Between two perils, one certain, the\nother only probable, there was no possible hesitation.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER CHANGE OF RESIDENCE.]\n\nAs for the chance of being picked up by some passing ship, they could\nnot reasonably rely upon it, for the Macquarie was out of the course\nusually taken in going to New Zealand. The shipwreck had happened on\nthe desert shores of Ika-Na-Maoui.\n\n\"When shall we start?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"To-morrow morning at ten o'clock,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"The tide\nwill begin to rise then, and will carry us ashore.\"\n\nEarly the next day the raft was finished. The captain had given\nhis entire attention to its construction. They needed a steady and\nmanageable craft, and one capable of resisting the waves for a voyage\nof nine miles. The masts of the brig could alone furnish the necessary\nmaterials.\n\nThe raft was at length completed. It could doubtless sustain the shock\nof the surges; but could it be steered, and the coast be reached, if\nthe wind should veer? This was a question only to be decided by trial.\n\nAt nine o'clock the loading began. The provisions were first put on\nboard in sufficient quantities to last until the arrival at Auckland,\nfor there could be no reliance upon the products of this dreaded\ncountry. Olbinett furnished some preserved meats, the remains of the\nMacquarie's supplies. There was very little, however; and they were\nforced to depend upon the coarse fare of the mess, which consisted of\nvery inferior ship-biscuits and two barrels of salt fish, greatly to\nthe steward's regret.\n\nThese stores were inclosed in sealed cans and then secured to the foot\nof the mast. The arms and ammunition were put in a safe and dry place.\nFortunately, the travelers were well supplied with rifles and revolvers.\n\nA small anchor was taken on board, in case they should reach the shore\nat low tide and be forced to anchor in the offing. Flood-tide soon\nbegan, the breeze blew gently from the northwest, and a slight swell\nagitated the surface of the sea.\n\n\"Are we ready?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"All is ready, captain,\" replied Wilson.\n\n\"Aboard, then!\"\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant descended the ship's side by a clumsy\nrope-ladder, and took their seats at the foot of the mast near the\ncases of provisions, their companions around them. Wilson took the\nhelm, the captain stationed himself at the sail-tackling, and Mulready\ncut the cable that confined the raft to the brig. The sail was spread,\nand they began to move towards the shore under the combined influence\nof wind and tide.\n\nThe coast was only nine miles distant,--not a difficult voyage for a\nwell-manned boat; but with the raft it was necessary to advance slowly.\nIf the wind held out, they might perhaps reach land with this tide; but\nif there should be a calm, the ebb would carry them back, or they would\nbe compelled to anchor and wait for the next tide.\n\nHowever, Captain Mangles hoped to succeed. The wind freshened. As it\nhad been flood now for some hours, they must either reach land soon, or\nanchor.\n\nFortune favored them. Gradually the black points of the rocks and\nthe yellow sand of the bars disappeared beneath the waves; but great\nattention and extreme skill became necessary, in this dangerous\nneighborhood, to guide their unwieldy craft.\n\nThey were still five miles from shore. A clear sky enabled them to\ndistinguish the principal features of the country. To the northeast\nrose a lofty mountain, whose outline was defined against the horizon in\na very singular resemblance to the grinning profile of a monkey.\n\nPaganel soon observed that all the sand-bars had disappeared.\n\n\"Except one,\" replied Lady Helena.\n\n\"Where?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"There,\" said Lady Helena, pointing to a black speck a mile ahead.\n\n\"That is true,\" answered Paganel. \"Let us try to determine its\nposition, that we may not run upon it when the tide covers it.\"\n\n[Illustration: The yawl was drawn alongside.]\n\n\"It is exactly at the northern projection of the mountain,\" said\nCaptain Mangles. \"Wilson, bear away towards the offing.\"\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied the sailor, bearing with all his weight upon\nthe steering oar.\n\nThey approached nearer; but, strange to say, the black point still\nrose above the water. The captain gazed at it attentively, and, to see\nbetter, employed Paganel's telescope.\n\n\"It is not a rock,\" said he, after a moment's examination; \"it is a\nfloating object, that rises and falls with the swell.\"\n\n\"Is it not a piece of the Macquarie's mast?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"No,\" replied Glenarvan; \"no fragment could have drifted so far from\nthe ship.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" cried Captain Mangles. \"I recognize it. It is the boat.\"\n\n\"The brig's boat?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, the brig's boat, bottom upwards.\"\n\n\"The unfortunate sailors!\" exclaimed Lady Helena, \"they have perished!\"", "\"The brig's boat?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, the brig's boat, bottom upwards.\"\n\n\"The unfortunate sailors!\" exclaimed Lady Helena, \"they have perished!\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" continued the captain; \"and they might have foreseen\nit; for in the midst of these breakers, on a stormy sea, and in such\nprofound darkness, they fled to certain death.\"\n\n\"May Heaven have pity on them!\" murmured Mary Grant.\n\nFor a few moments the passengers were silent. They gazed at this frail\nbark towards which they drew nearer and nearer. It had evidently\ncapsized a considerable distance from land, and of those who embarked\nin it probably not one had survived.\n\n\"But this boat may be useful,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"Come about, Wilson.\"\n\n[Sidenote: REALITIES AND FANCIES.]\n\nThe direction of the raft was changed, but the wind subsided gradually,\nand it cost them much time to reach the boat. Mulready, standing at the\nbow, warded off the shock, and the yawl was drawn alongside.\n\n\"Empty?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied the sailor, \"the boat is empty, and her seams\nhave started open. She is of no use to us.\"\n\n\"Can we not save any part?\" asked MacNabb.\n\n\"No,\" answered the captain. \"She is only fit to burn.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Paganel, \"for the yawl might have taken us to\nAuckland.\"\n\n\"We must be resigned, Mr. Paganel,\" rejoined the captain. \"Moreover, on\nsuch a rough sea, I prefer our raft to that frail conveyance. A slight\nshock would dash it in pieces! Therefore, my lord, we have nothing more\nto stay here for.\"\n\n\"As you wish, John,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Forward, Wilson,\" continued the young captain, \"straight for the\ncoast!\"\n\nThe tide would yet flow for about an hour, and in this time they could\naccomplish a considerable distance. But soon the breeze subsided almost\nentirely, and the raft was motionless. Soon it even began to drift\ntowards the open sea under the influence of the ebb.\n\nThe captain did not hesitate a moment.\n\n\"Anchor!\" cried he.\n\nMulready, who was in an instant ready to execute this order, let fall\nthe anchor, and the raft drifted till the cable was taut. The sail was\nreefed, and arrangements were made for a long detention. Indeed, the\ntide would not turn till late in the evening; and, as they did not care\nto sail in the dark, they anchored for the night in sight of land.\n\nQuite a heavy swell agitated the surface of the water, and seemed to\nset steadily towards the shore. Glenarvan, therefore, when he learned\nthat the whole night would be passed on board, asked why they did not\ntake advantage of this current to approach the coast.\n\n[Illustration: Night approached. Already the sun's disk was\ndisappearing beneath the horizon.]\n\n[Illustration: The ladies were carried in their companions' arms, and\nreached the shore without wetting a single fold of their garments.]\n\n\"My lord,\" replied the young captain, \"is deceived by an optical\nillusion. The apparent onward movement is only an oscillation of the\nwater, nothing more. Throw a piece of wood into the water, and you will\nsee that it will remain stationary, so long as the ebb is not felt. We\nmust therefore have patience.\"\n\n\"And dinner,\" added the major.\n\nOlbinett took out of a case of provisions some pieces of dried meat and\na dozen biscuits, though reluctant to offer such meagre fare. It was\naccepted, however, with good grace, even by the ladies, whose appetites\nthe fresh sea air greatly improved.\n\nNight approached. Already the sun's disk, glowing with crimson, was\ndisappearing beneath the horizon; and the waters glistened and sparkled\nlike sheets of liquid silver under his last rays. Nothing could be\nseen but sky and water, except one sharply-defined object, the hull of\nthe Macquarie, motionless on the reefs. The short twilight was rapidly\nfollowed by the darkness, and soon the land that bounded the horizon\nsome miles away was lost in the gloom. In this perplexing situation\nthese shipwrecked people lapsed into an uneasy and distressing\ndrowsiness, and as the result at daybreak all were more exhausted than\nrefreshed.\n\nWith the turn of the tide the wind rose. It was six o'clock in the\nmorning, and time was precious. Preparations were made for getting\nunder way, and the order was given to weigh anchor; but the flukes,\nby the strain of the cable, were so deeply imbedded in the sand that\nwithout the windlass even the tackling that Wilson arranged could not\ndraw them out.\n\n[Sidenote: TERRA-FIRMA ONCE MORE.]\n\nHalf an hour passed in useless efforts. The captain, impatient to set\nsail, cut the cable, and thus took away all possibility of anchoring,\nin case the tide should not enable them to reach the shore. The sail\nwas unfurled, and they drifted slowly towards the land that rose in\ngrayish masses against the background of the sky, illumined by the\nrising sun. The reefs were skillfully avoided, but, with the unsteady\nbreeze, they did not seem to draw nearer the shore.\n\nAt last, however, land was less than a mile distant, craggy with rocks\nand very precipitous. It was necessary to find a practicable landing.\nThe wind now moderated and soon subsided entirely, the sail flapping\nidly against the mast. The tide alone moved the raft; but they had to\ngive up steering, and masses of sea-weed retarded their progress.\n\nAfter awhile they gradually became stationary three cable-lengths from\nshore. But they had no anchor, and would they not be carried out to\nsea again by the ebb? With eager glance and anxious heart the captain\nlooked towards the inaccessible shore.\n\nJust at this moment a shock was felt. The raft stopped. They had\nstranded on a sand-bar, not far from the coast. Glenarvan, Robert,\nWilson, and Mulready leaped into the water, and moored their bark\nfirmly with cables on the adjoining reefs. The ladies were carried in\ntheir companions' arms, and reached the shore without wetting a single\nfold of their garments; and soon all, with arms and provisions, had set\nfoot on the inhospitable shores of New Zealand.\n\nGlenarvan, without losing an hour, would have followed the coast to\nAuckland; but since early morning the sky had been heavy with clouds,\nwhich, towards noon, descended in torrents of rain. Hence it was\nimpossible to start on their journey, and advisable to seek a shelter.\n\n[Illustration: While the fire served to dry their garments conversation\nbeguiled the hours, as they lay or stood at ease.]\n\nWilson discovered, fortunately, a cavern, hollowed out by the sea in\nthe basaltic rocks of the shore, and here the travelers took refuge\nwith their arms and provisions. There was an abundance of dry sea-weed,\nlately cast up by the waves. This formed a soft couch, of which they\navailed themselves. Several pieces of wood were piled up at the\nentrance and then kindled; and while the fire served to dry their\ngarments conversation beguiled the hours, as they lay or stood at ease.\n\n[Illustration: Louper, with difficulty, managed to support himself on\none of them.]\n\n[Sidenote: SEALS AND SIRENS.]\n\nPaganel, as usual, upon being appealed to, could tell them of the\nrise, extension, and consolidation of the British power upon the\nisland; he informed them of the beginnings--and, to his belief, of\nthe causes--of the strife which for years decimated the aborigines,\nand was very injurious to the colonists who had emigrated; then, in\nreply to Robert's questions, he went on to speak of those who on a\nnarrower theatre had emulated by their heroism and patience the deeds\nof the world's great travelers and scientific explorers. He told them\nof Witcombe and Charlton Howitt, men known in their own circles and\nin connection with their own branch of the New Zealand government.\nAt still greater length he detailed the adventures of Jacob Louper,\nwho was the companion of Witcombe, and had gone as his assistant\nto discover a practicable route over the mountains in the north of\nthe province of Canterbury. In those mountain wilds, which even the\nislanders rarely traverse, these two Europeans suffered greatly, but\nstill worse was their fate when they descended to the water-level and\nessayed to cross the Taramakau near its mouth. Jacob Louper at length\nfound two old and almost useless canoes, and by attaching the one to\nthe other they hoped to accomplish the passage safely. Before they\nhad reached the middle of the rapid current, however, both the tubs\ncapsized. Louper, with difficulty, managed to support himself on one\nof them, and by clinging to it was at length carried to the river's\nbank, which his companion also reached; but when after a period of\ninsensibility Louper returned to consciousness and found the body of\nWitcombe, it was lifeless. Though terribly bruised and still bleeding\nfrom his wounds, Louper hollowed a grave for the remains, and then,\nafter many more days of privation and danger, came to the huts of some\nof the Maoris, by whose assistance he at length reached the settled\nparts of the colony.\n\nThese facts and reminiscences, it must be confessed, were not of the\nmost inspiriting character; but they were in the same key as most of\nPaganel's disquisitions and information concerning these islands, and\nthey were before a late hour exchanged for peaceful though probably\ndreamy slumbers, by his hearers.\n\nEarly the next morning the signal for departure was given. The rain had\nceased during the night, and the sky was covered with grayish clouds,\nwhich intercepted the rays of the sun, so that the temperature thus\nmoderated enabled them to endure the fatigues of the journey.\n\nBy consulting the map, Paganel had calculated that they would have to\ntravel eight days. But, instead of following the windings of the coast,\nhe considered it best to proceed to the village of Ngarnavahia, at the\njunction of the Waikato and Waipa rivers. Here the overland mail-road\npassed, and it would thence be easy to reach Drury, and rest, after\ntheir hardships, in a comfortable hotel.", "But before they left the shore their attention was drawn to the large\nnumber of seals, of a peculiar appearance and genus, which lay on the\nbroad sands daily washed by the tidal water. These seals, with their\nrounded heads, their upturned look, their expressive eyes, presented an\nappearance, almost a physiognomy, that was mild and wellnigh tender,\nand served to recall to the traveler's memory the tales about the\nsirens of the olden and modern times, who served as the enchantresses\nto just such inhospitable shores as that seemed on which they had\nthemselves been cast. These animals, which are very numerous on the\ncoast of New Zealand, are hunted and killed for the sake of their\noil and their skins, and Paganel was of course able to tell how much\nwithin the last few years they had been searched for by the traders and\nnavigators on these seas.\n\n[Illustration: These seals, with rounded heads, upturned look,\nexpressive eyes, presented an appearance, almost a physiognomy, that\nwas mild and wellnigh tender.]\n\n[Illustration: The New Zealand \"kiwi,\" known to naturalists as the\napteryx.]\n\nWhilst speaking of these matters, Robert drew Paganel's attention to\nsome curious amphibious creatures, resembling the seals, but larger,\nwhich were devouring with rapidity the large stones lying on the shore.\n\n\"Look,\" said he, \"here are seals which feed on pebbles.\"\n\nPaganel assured them that these sea-elephants were only weighting\nthemselves preparatory to their descent into the water, and protested\nthat if they would but wait for a time they might see them descend and\nsubsequently return when they had unloaded themselves. The first part\nof this programme they saw accomplished; but, greatly to Paganel's\ngrief, Glenarvan would not longer delay the party, and they soon began\nto see inland beauties and curiosities of another sort.\n\nThe district through which they had to walk this day and the next was\none very thick with brush and under-wood, and there was no possibility\nof horse or vehicle passing or meeting them. They now regretted the\nabsence of their Australian cart, for the height and frequency of\nthe large ferns in the neighborhood prevented their making any rapid\nprogress on foot.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST STAGE OF PERIPATETICS.]\n\nHere and there, however, Robert and Paganel would rejoice together\nover some choice bush or bird that they had met with. Notable among\nthe latter was the New Zealand \"kiwi,\" known to naturalists as the\napteryx, and which is becoming very scarce, from the pursuit of its\nmany enemies. Robert discovered in a nest on the ground a couple of\nthese birds without tails or wings, but with four toes on the foot, and\na long beak or bill like that of a woodcock, and small white feathers\nall over its body. Of this bird there was then an entire absence in the\nzoological collections of Europe, and Paganel indulged the hope that he\nmight be able to be the proud contributor of such a valuable specimen\nto the \"Jardin\" of his own city. For the present, at least, the\nrealization of his hopes had to be deferred; and at length, after some\ndays of weariness and continued travel, the party reached the banks\nof the Waipa. The country was deserted. There was no sign of natives,\nno path that would indicate the presence of man in these regions. The\nwaters of the river flowed between tall bushes, or glided over sandy\nshallows, while the range of vision extended to the hills that inclosed\nthe valley on the east.\n\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon nine miles had been valiantly\naccomplished. According to the map, which Paganel continually\nconsulted, the junction of the Waikato and Waipa could not be more\nthan five miles distant. The road to Auckland passed this point, and\nthere they would encamp for the night. As for the fifty miles that\nwould still separate them from the capital, two or three days would\nbe sufficient for this, and even eight hours, if they should meet the\nmail-coach.\n\n\"Then,\" said Glenarvan, \"we shall be compelled to encamp again\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Paganel; \"but, as I hope, for the last time.\"\n\n\"So much the better; for these are severe hardships for Lady Helena and\nMary Grant.\"\n\n\"And they endure them heroically,\" added Captain Mangles. \"But, if I am\nnot mistaken, Mr. Paganel, you have spoken of a village situated at the\njunction of the two rivers.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the geographer; \"here it is on the map. It is\nNgarnavahia, about two miles below the junction.\"\n\n\"Well, could we not lodge there for the night? Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant would not hesitate to go two miles farther, if they could find a\ntolerable hotel.\"\n\n\"A hotel!\" cried Paganel. \"A hotel in a Maori village! There is not\neven a tavern. This village is only a collection of native huts;\nand, far from seeking shelter there, my advice is to avoid it most\ncarefully.\"\n\n\"Always your fears, Paganel!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"My dear lord, distrust is better than confidence among the Maoris. I\ndo not know upon what terms they are with the English. Now, timidity\naside, such as ourselves would be fine prizes, and I dislike to try New\nZealand hospitality. I therefore think it wise to avoid this village,\nand likewise any meeting with the natives. Once at Drury, it will be\ndifferent, and there our courageous ladies can refresh themselves at\ntheir ease for the fatigues of their journey.\"\n\nThe geographer's opinion prevailed. Lady Helena preferred to pass\nthe last night in the open air rather than to expose her companions.\nNeither she nor Mary Grant required a halt, and they therefore\ncontinued to follow the banks of the river.\n\nTwo hours after, the first shadows of evening began to descend the\nmountains. The sun before disappearing below the western horizon had\nglinted a few rays through a rift in the clouds. The eastern peaks were\ncrimsoned with the last beams of day.\n\nGlenarvan and his friends hastened their pace. They knew the shortness\nof the twilight in this latitude, and how quickly night sets in. It\nwas important to reach the junction of the two rivers before it became\ndark. But a dense fog rose from the earth, and made it very difficult\nto distinguish the way.\n\nFortunately, hearing availed in place of sight. Soon a distinct murmur\nof the waters indicated the union of the two streams in a common bed,\nand not long after the little party arrived at the point where the\nWaipa mingles with the Waikato in resounding cascades.\n\n\"Here is the Waikato,\" cried Paganel, \"and the road to Auckland runs\nalong its right bank.\"\n\n\"We shall see to-morrow,\" replied the major. \"Let us encamp here. It\nseems to me as if those deeper shadows yonder proceeded from a little\nthicket of trees that has grown here expressly to shelter us. Let us\neat and sleep.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A TRANSFORMATION SCENE.]\n\n\"Eat,\" said Paganel, \"but of biscuits and dried meat, without kindling\na fire. We have arrived here unseen; let us try to go away in the same\nmanner. Fortunately, this fog will render us invisible.\"\n\nThe group of trees was reached, and each conformed to the geographer's\nrigorous regulations. The cold supper was noiselessly eaten, and soon a\nprofound sleep overcame the weary travelers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE CANNIBALS.\n\n\nThe next morning at break of day a dense fog was spreading heavily over\nthe river, but the rays of the sun were not long in piercing the mist,\nwhich rapidly disappeared under the influence of the radiant orb. The\nbanks of the stream were released from their shroud, and the course of\nthe Waikato appeared in all its morning beauty.\n\nA narrow tongue of land bristling with shrubbery ran out to a point\nat the junction of the two rivers. The waters of the Waipa, which\nflowed more swiftly, drove back those of the Waikato for a quarter of a\nmile before they mingled; but the calm power of the one soon overcame\nthe boisterous impetuosity of the other, and both glided peacefully\ntogether to the broad bosom of the Pacific.\n\nAs the mist rose, a boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad. The lofty prow resembled\nthat of a Venetian gondola, and the whole had been fashioned out of the\ntrunk of a pine. A bed of dry fern covered the bottom. Eight oars at\nthe bow propelled it up the river, while a man at the stern guided it\nby means of a movable paddle.\n\nThis man was a native, of tall form, about forty-five years old, with\nbroad breast and powerful limbs. His protruding and deeply furrowed\nbrow, his fierce look and his sinister countenance, showed him to be a\nformidable individual.\n\nHe was a Maori chief of high rank, as could be seen by the delicate\nand compact tattooing that striped his face and body. Two black\nspirals, starting from the nostrils of his aquiline nose, circled his\ntawny eyes, met on his forehead, and were lost in his abundant hair.\nHis mouth, with its shining teeth, and his chin, were hidden beneath\na net-work of varied colors, while graceful lines wound down to his\nsinewy breast.\n\nThere was no doubt as to his rank. The sharp albatross bone, used\nby Maori tattooers, had furrowed his face five times, in close and\ndeep lines. That he had reached his fifth promotion was evident from\nhis haughty bearing. A large flaxen mat, ornamented with dog-skins,\nenveloped his person; while a girdle, bloody with his recent conflicts,\nencircled his waist. From his ears dangled ear-rings of green jade, and\naround his neck hung necklaces of \"pounamous,\" sacred stones to which\nthe New Zealanders attribute miraculous properties. At his side lay a\ngun of English manufacture, and a \"patou-patou,\" a kind of double-edged\nhatchet.\n\nNear him nine warriors, of lower rank, armed and of ferocious aspect,\nsome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.", "In the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pih\u00e9,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]", "[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the close of the day two more rapids were ascended, and\nat evening Kai-Koumou encamped a hundred miles above the junction of\nthe two streams. The river now turned towards the east, and then again\nflowed southward into Lake Taupo.\n\nThe next morning Jacques Paganel consulted his map and discovered\non the right bank Mount Taubara, which rises to the height of three\nthousand feet. At noon the whole fleet of boats entered Lake Taupo, and\nthe natives hailed with frantic gestures a shred of cloth that waved in\nthe wind from the roof of a hut. It was the national flag.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nA MOMENTOUS INTERVIEW.\n\n\n[Sidenote: NEW ZEALAND TOPOGRAPHY.]\n\nLong before historic times, an abyss, twenty-five miles long and\ntwenty wide, must at some period have been formed by a subsidence of\nsubterranean caverns in the volcanic district forming the centre of\nthe island. The waters of the surrounding country have rushed down and\nfilled this enormous cavity, and the abyss has become a lake, whose\ndepth no one has yet been able to measure.\n\nSuch is this strange Lake Taupo, elevated eleven hundred and fifty\nfeet above the level of the sea, and surrounded by lofty mountains. On\nthe west of the prisoners towered precipitous rocks of imposing form;\non the north rose several distant ridges, crowned with small forests;\non the east spread a broad plain furrowed by a trail and covered with\npumice-stones that glittered beneath a net-work of bushes; and on\nthe north, behind a stretch of woodland, volcanic peaks majestically\nencircled this vast extent of water, the fury of whose tempests equaled\nthat of the ocean cyclones.\n\nBut Paganel was scarcely disposed to enlarge his account of these\nwonders, nor were his friends in a mood to listen. They gazed in\nsilence towards the northeast shore of the lake, whither the canoe was\nbringing them.\n\nThe mission established at Pukawa, on the western shores, no longer\nexisted. The missionary had been driven by the war far from the\nprincipal dwellings of the insurrectionists. The prisoners were\nhelpless, abandoned to the mercy of the vengeful Maoris, and in that\nwild part of the island to which Christianity has never penetrated.\nKai-Koumou, leaving the waters of the Waikato, passed through the\nlittle creek which served as an outlet to the river, doubled a sharp\npromontory, and landed on the eastern border of the lake, at the base\nof the first slopes of Mount Manga.\n\nA quarter of a mile distant, on a buttress of the mountain, appeared\na \"pah,\" a Maori fortification, situated in an impregnable position.\nThe prisoners were taken ashore, with their hands and feet free, and\nconducted thither by the warriors. After quite a long d\u00e9tour, Glenarvan\nand his companions reached the pah.\n\n[Illustration: At noon the whole fleet of boats entered Lake Taupo.]\n\n[Illustration: On their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed\nat sight of the heads that ornamented the stakes of the second\ninclosure.]\n\nThis fortress was defended by an outer rampart of strong palisades,\nfifteen feet high. A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged.\n\nOn their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice. This hut rested against a rock that\nrose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of\nthe fortification. In this consecrated temple the priests, or \"arikis,\"\ninstruct the New Zealanders. The building was spacious and tightly\nclosed, and contained the holy and chosen food of the god.\n\nHere the prisoners, temporarily sheltered from the fury of the natives,\nstretched themselves on the flax mats. Lady Helena, her strength\nexhausted and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms.\nGlenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said:\n\n\"Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!\"\n\nRobert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's\nshoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening\nbetween the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging.\nFrom this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far\nas Kai-Koumou's hut.\n\n\"They have gathered around the chief,\" said he, in a low voice. \"They\nare waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak.\"\n\nThe boy was silent for a few moments, then continued:\n\n\"Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen.\"\n\n\"This chief,\" said the major, \"has evidently a personal interest in\nprotecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of\nhis tribe. But will his warriors consent?\"\n\n\"Yes, they are listening to him,\" continued Robert. \"They are\ndispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification.\"\n\n\"Is it really so?\" cried the major.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Robert. \"Kai-Koumou remains alone with the\nwarriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!\"\n\n[Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed\non Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an\nopening.]\n\n\"Get down, Robert,\" said Glenarvan.\n\nAt this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm.\n\n\"Edward,\" said she, in a firm voice, \"neither Mary Grant nor I shall\nfall alive into the hands of those savages!\"\n\nAnd, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver.\n\n\"A weapon!\" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened.\n\n\"Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon\nis for us, Edward, not for them.\"", "\"A weapon!\" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened.\n\n\"Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon\nis for us, Edward, not for them.\"\n\n\"Glenarvan,\" said MacNabb quickly, \"hide the revolver. It is not time\nyet.\"\n\nThe weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that\nclosed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a\nsign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed\nthrough the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou.\n\nAround him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among\nwhom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the\nriver. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel\naspect. His name was Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9, which means in the native language\n\"The Irascible.\" Kai-Koumou treated him with some respect, and from\nthe delicacy of his tattooing it was evident that he occupied a high\nrank in his tribe. An observer, however, would have detected a rivalry\nbetween the two chiefs. The major, indeed, perceived that Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9's\ninfluence surpassed that of Kai-Koumou. They both ruled the powerful\ntribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview,\nalthough Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility.\n\nHe now questioned Glenarvan.\n\n\"You are English?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality\nwould probably facilitate an exchange.\n\n[Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.]\n\n\"And your companions?\" asked Kai-Koumou.\n\n\"My companions are also English. We are shipwrecked travelers, and, if\nyou care to know, we have taken no part in the war.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9, brutally. \"Every Englishman is our\nenemy. Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our\nfields; they have burned our villages.\"\n\n\"They have done wrong,\" said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. \"I say so\nbecause I think so, and not because I am in your power.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Tohonga, the high-priest of\nNou\u00ef-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner\nof the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life.\nI would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions'\nheads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nou\u00ef-Atoua\nhas spoken.\"\n\nSo saying, Kai-Koumou, who had hitherto controlled himself, trembled\nwith rage, and his countenance was flushed with a fierce exultation.\nThen, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly:\n\n\"Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?\"\n\nGlenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively.\n\n\"I do not know,\" said he, after a moment's silence.\n\n\"Speak,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Glenarvan. \"I am neither a chief nor a priest among my\npeople.\"\n\nPaganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound\nwonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised.\n\n\"Then you doubt it?\" said he.\n\n\"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan.\n\n\"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\"\n\n\"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\"\n\n\"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered\nGlenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would\nhave rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her.\n\n\"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards\nthem, \"hold a high rank in their country.\"\n\nThe warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\"\n\nThen, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\"\n\n\"No, mine!\" cried Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nThen, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch.\n\n\"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror.\n\nGlenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded.\nKara-T\u00e9t\u00e9 fell dead.\n\nAt this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was\nfilled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives.\nGlenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand.\n\nKai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with\none hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other\nthe throng that was rushing upon the Europeans.\n\n[Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.", "\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this.\n\nKara-T\u00e9t\u00e9's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared.\nShe was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders.\nVague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.\n\nAt this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"m\u00e9r\u00e9,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.\n\n[Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!]\n\nFrightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended.\n\nKara-T\u00e9t\u00e9's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNou\u00ef-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the m\u00e9r\u00e9, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9 and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands. If Heaven has decreed that we shall die to-morrow, we can,\nI am sure, die like brave people, like Christians, ready to appear\nfearlessly before the final Judge. God, who does read the secrets of\nthe soul, knows that we are fulfilling a noble mission. If death awaits\nus instead of success, it is his will. However severe his decree may\nbe, I shall not murmur against it. But this is not death alone; it is\ntorture, disgrace; and here are two women----\"\n\nGlenarvan's voice, hitherto firm, now faltered. He paused to control\nhis emotion. After a moment's silence, he said to the young captain:\n\n\"John, you have promised Mary Grant what I have promised Lady Helena.\nWhat have you resolved?\"\n\n\"This promise,\" replied John Mangles, \"I believe I have the right in\nthe sight of God to fulfill.\"\n\n\"Yes, John; but we have no weapons.\"", "\"This promise,\" replied John Mangles, \"I believe I have the right in\nthe sight of God to fulfill.\"\n\n\"Yes, John; but we have no weapons.\"\n\n\"Here is one,\" answered John, displaying a poniard. \"I snatched it from\nKara-T\u00e9t\u00e9's hands when he fell at your feet. My lord, he of us who\nsurvives the other shall fulfill this vow.\"\n\nAt these words a profound silence reigned in the hut. At last the major\ninterrupted it by saying:\n\n\"My friends, reserve this extreme measure till the last moment. I am no\nadvocate of what is irremediable.\"\n\n\"I do not speak for ourselves,\" replied Glenarvan. \"We can brave\ndeath, whatever it may be. Ah, if we were alone! Twenty times already\nwould I have urged you to make a sally and attack those wretches. But\n_they_----\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE APPROACH OF DAY.]\n\nAt this moment Captain Mangles raised the mat and counted twenty-five\nnatives, who were watching at the door of their prison. A great fire\nhad been kindled, which cast a dismal light over the irregular outlines\nof the pah. Some of these savages were stretched around the fire; and\nothers, standing and motionless, were darkly defined against the bright\ncurtain of flame.\n\nIt is said that, between the jailer who watches and the prisoner who\nwishes to escape, the chances are on the side of the latter. Indeed,\nthe design of one is stronger than that of the other, for the first\nmay forget that he is guarding, but the second cannot forget that he\nis guarded; the captive thinks oftener of escaping than his guardian\nthinks of preventing his escape. But here it was hate and vengeance\nthat watched the prisoners, and not an indifferent jailer. They had not\nbeen bound, for bonds were useless where twenty-five men guarded the\nonly outlet of the prison.\n\nThis hut was built against the rock that terminated the fortification,\nand was only accessible by a narrow passage that connected it with the\nfront of the pah. The other two sides of the building were flanked\nby towering precipices, and stood on the verge of an abyss a hundred\nfeet deep. A descent this way was therefore impossible. There was no\nchance of escaping in the rear, which was guarded by the enormous rock.\nThe only exit was the door of the temple, and the Maoris defended the\nnarrow passage that connected it with the pah. All escape was therefore\nout of the question; and Glenarvan, after examining the walls of his\nprison, was forced to acknowledge this disheartening fact.\n\nMeantime, the hours of this night of anguish were passing away. Dense\ndarkness had covered the mountain. Neither moon nor stars illumined\nthe deep shades. A few gusts of wind swept along the side of the\npah. The stakes of the hut groaned, the fire of the natives suddenly\nrevived at this passing draught, and the flames cast rapid flashes\ninto the temple, illumining for a moment the group of prisoners. These\npoor people were absorbed with their last thoughts; a deathly silence\nreigned in the hut.\n\nIt must have been about four o'clock in the morning, when the major's\nattention was attracted by a slight sound that seemed to come from\nbehind the rear stakes, in the back wall that lay towards the rock. At\nfirst he was indifferent to the noise, but finding that it continued,\nhe listened. At last, puzzled by its persistence, he put his ear close\nto the ground to hear better. It seemed as if some one was scraping and\ndigging outside.\n\nWhen he was certain of this fact, he passed quietly towards Glenarvan\nand the captain, and led them to the rear of the hut.\n\n\"Listen,\" said he, in a low voice, motioning to them to bend down.\n\nThe scrapings became more and more audible. They could hear the little\nstones grate under the pressure of a sharp instrument and fall down\noutside.\n\n\"Some creature in its burrow,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\nGlenarvan, with bewildered gaze, stood astonished.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, \"but that it is a man?\"\n\n\"Man or animal,\" replied the major, \"I will know what is going on.\"\n\nWilson and Olbinett joined their companions, and all began to dig in\nthe wall, the captain with his poniard, the others with stones pulled\nout of the ground, or with their nails, while Mulready, stretched on\nthe earth, watched the group of natives through the loop-hole of the\nmat. But they were motionless around the fire, and did not suspect what\nwas transpiring twenty paces from them.\n\nThe soil was loose and crumbling, and lay upon a bed of clay, so that,\nin spite of the want of tools, the hole rapidly enlarged. It was soon\nevident that somebody, clinging to the sides of the pah, was making a\npassage in its outer wall. What could be the object? Did he know of the\nexistence of the prisoners, or could a mere chance attempt at escape\nexplain the work that seemed nearly completed?\n\n[Sidenote: HEAVENLY HELP FROM AN EARTHLY HAND.]\n\nThe captives redoubled their efforts. Their lacerated fingers bled,\nbut still they dug on. After half an hour's labor, the hole they were\ndrilling had reached a depth of three feet. They could perceive by the\nsounds, which were now more distinct, that only a thin layer of earth\nprevented immediate communication.\n\nA few moments more elapsed, when suddenly the major drew back his hand,\nwhich was cut by a sharp blade. He suppressed a cry that was about to\nescape him. Captain Mangles, holding out his poniard, avoided the knife\nthat was moving out of the ground, but seized the hand that held it.\nIt was the hand of a woman or a youth, a European hand. Not a word had\nbeen uttered on either side. There was plainly an object in keeping\nsilent.\n\n\"Is it Robert?\" murmured Glenarvan.\n\nBut, though only whispering this name, Mary Grant, awakened by the\nmovement that was taking place in the hut, glided towards Glenarvan,\nand, seizing this hand all soiled with mud, covered it with kisses.\n\n\"It is you! it is you!\" cried the young girl, who could not be\nmistaken, \"you, my Robert!\"\n\n\"Yes, little sister,\" replied Robert, \"I am here to save you all! But\nsilence!\"\n\n\"Brave lad!\" repeated Glenarvan.\n\n\"Keep watch of the savages outside,\" continued Robert.\n\nMulready, whose attention had been diverted for a moment by the\nappearance of the hand, resumed his post of observation.\n\n\"All is well,\" said he. \"Only four warriors are watching now. The\nothers have fallen asleep.\"\n\n\"Courage!\" replied Wilson.\n\nIn an instant the hole was widened, and Robert passed from the arms of\nhis sister into those of Lady Helena. Around his body was wound a rope\nof flax.\n\n\"My boy! my boy!\" murmured Lady Helena; \"these savages did not kill\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, madam,\" replied Robert. \"Somehow, during the uproar, I succeeded\nin escaping their vigilance. I crossed the yard. For two days I kept\nhidden behind the bushes. At night I wandered about, longing to see you\nagain. While the tribe were occupied with the funeral of the chief,\nI came and examined this side of the fortification, where the prison\nstands, and saw that I could reach you. I stole this knife and rope\nin a deserted hut. The tufts of grass and the bushes helped me to\nclimb. By chance I found a kind of grotto hollowed out in the very rock\nagainst which this hut rests. I had only a few feet to dig in the soft\nearth, and here I am.\"\n\nTwenty silent kisses were his only answer.\n\n\"Let us start,\" said he, in a decided tone.\n\n\"Is Paganel below?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"Mr. Paganel?\" repeated the boy, surprised apparently at the question.\n\n\"Yes; is he waiting for us?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. What! is he not here?\"\n\n\"He is not, Robert,\" replied Mary Grant.\n\n\"What! have you not seen him?\" exclaimed Glenarvan. \"Did you not meet\neach other in the confusion? Did you not escape together?\"\n\n\"No, my lord,\" answered Robert, at a loss to understand the\ndisappearance of his friend Paganel.\n\n\"Let us start,\" said the major; \"there is not a moment to lose.\nWherever Paganel may be, his situation cannot be worse than ours here.\nLet us go.\"\n\nIndeed, the moments were precious. It was high time to start.\nThe escape presented no great difficulties, but for the almost\nperpendicular wall of rock outside of the grotto, twenty feet high. The\ndeclivity then sloped quite gently to the base of the mountain, from\nwhich point the captives could quickly gain the lower valleys, while\nthe Maoris, if they chanced to discover their flight, would be forced\nto make a very long d\u00e9tour, since they were not aware of the passage\nthat had been dug in the mountain.\n\n[Illustration: First her husband, and then she, slid down the rope to\nthe point where the perpendicular wall met the summit of the slope.]\n\nThey now prepared to escape, and every precaution was taken to insure\ntheir success. The captives crawled one by one through the narrow\npassage, and found themselves in the grotto. Captain Mangles, before\nleaving the hut, concealed all traces of their work, and glided in his\nturn through the opening, which he closed with the mats. Their outlet\nwas therefore entirely hidden.\n\nThe object now was to descend the perpendicular wall of rock, which\nwould have been impossible if Robert had not brought the flax rope. It\nwas unwound, fastened to a point of rock, and thrown over the declivity.\n\nBefore allowing his friends to trust their weight to these flaxen\nfibres, Captain Mangles tested them. They seemed to be quite strong,\nbut it would not answer to venture rashly, for a fall might be fatal.\n\n\"This rope,\" said he, \"can only bear the weight of two bodies, and we\nmust therefore act accordingly. Let Lord and Lady Glenarvan slide down\nfirst. When they have reached the bottom, three shakes at the rope will\nbe the signal to follow them.\"\n\n\"I will go first,\" replied Robert. \"I have discovered at the base of\nthe slope a sort of deep excavation, where those who descend first can\nwait for the others in safety.\"\n\n\"Go then, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, clasping the boy's hand.\n\nRobert disappeared through the opening of the grotto. A moment after,\nthree shakes of the rope informed them that he had accomplished his\ndescent successfully.", "Robert disappeared through the opening of the grotto. A moment after,\nthree shakes of the rope informed them that he had accomplished his\ndescent successfully.\n\nGlenarvan and Lady Helena now ventured out of the grotto. The\ndarkness below was still profound, but the gray light of dawn was\nalready tinging the top of the mountain. The keen cold of the morning\nreanimated the young wife; she felt stronger, and commenced her\nperilous escape.\n\n[Sidenote: A PRECIPITATE DESCENT.]\n\nFirst her husband, and then she, slid down the rope to the point where\nthe perpendicular wall met the summit of the slope. Then Glenarvan,\ngoing before his wife and assisting her, began to descend the\ndeclivity of the mountain backwards. He sought for tufts of grass and\nbushes that offered a point of support, and tried them before placing\nLady Helena's feet upon them. Several birds, suddenly awakened, flew\naway with shrill cries, and the fugitives shuddered when a large stone\nrolled noisily to the base of the mountain.\n\nThey had accomplished half the distance when a voice was heard at the\nopening of the grotto.\n\n\"Stop!\" whispered Captain Mangles.\n\nGlenarvan, clinging with one hand to a tuft of grass and holding his\nwife with the other, waited, scarcely breathing.\n\nWilson had taken alarm. Hearing some noise outside, he had returned to\nthe hut, and, raising the mat, watched the Maoris. At a sign from him\nthe captain had stopped Glenarvan.\n\nIn truth, one of the warriors, startled by some unaccustomed sound,\nhad risen and approached the prison. Standing two paces from the\nhut, he listened with lowered head. He remained in this attitude\nfor a moment, that seemed an hour, with ear intent and eye on the\nalert. Then, shaking his head as a man who is mistaken, he returned\nto his companions, took an armful of dead wood and threw it on the\nhalf-extinct fire, whose flames revived. His face, brightly illumined\nby the blaze, betrayed no more anxiety, and, after gazing at the first\nglimmers of dawn that tinged the horizon, he stretched himself beside\nthe fire to warm his cold limbs.\n\n\"All right!\" said Wilson.\n\nThe captain made a sign to Glenarvan to continue his descent. The\nlatter, accordingly, slid gently down the slope, and soon Lady Helena\nand he stood on the narrow path where Robert was waiting for them. The\nrope was shaken three times, and next Captain Mangles, followed by Mary\nGrant, took the same perilous course. They were successful, and joined\nLord and Lady Glenarvan.\n\nFive minutes later all the fugitives, after their fortunate escape\nfrom the hut, left this temporary retreat, and, avoiding the inhabited\nshores of the lake, made their way by narrow paths farther down the\nmountain. They advanced rapidly, seeking to avoid all points where they\nmight be seen. They did not speak, but glided like shadows through the\nbushes. Where were they going? At random, it is true, but they were\nfree.\n\nAbout five o'clock day began to break. Purple tints colored the lofty\nbanks of clouds. The mountain peaks emerged from the mists of the\nmorning. The orb of day would not be long in appearing, and instead of\nbeing the signal for torture, was to betray the flight of the condemned.\n\nBefore this dreaded moment arrived it was important that the fugitives\nshould be beyond the reach of the savages. But they could not advance\nquickly, for the paths were steep. Lady Helena scaled the declivities,\nsupported and even carried by Glenarvan, while Mary Grant leaned upon\nthe arm of her betrothed. Robert, happy and triumphant, whose heart was\nfull of joy at his success, took the lead, followed by the two sailors.\n\nFor half an hour the fugitives wandered at a venture. Paganel was not\nthere to guide them,--Paganel, the object of their fears, whose absence\ncast a dark shadow over their happiness. However, they proceeded\ntowards the east as well as possible, in the face of a magnificent\ndawn. They had soon reached an elevation of five hundred feet above\nLake Taupo, and the morning air at this altitude was keen and cold.\nHills and mountains rose one above another in indistinct outlines; but\nGlenarvan only wished to conceal himself and his companions. Afterwards\nthey would see about issuing from this winding labyrinth.\n\n[Illustration: They saw, but were also seen.]\n\nAt last the sun appeared and flashed his first rays into the faces of\nthe fugitives. Suddenly a terrible yelling, the concentrated union of a\nhundred voices, broke forth upon the air. It rose from the pah, whose\nexact position Glenarvan did not now know. Moreover, a thick curtain of\nmist stretched at their feet, and prevented them from distinguishing\nthe valleys below.\n\nBut the fugitives could not doubt that their escape had been\ndiscovered. Could they elude the pursuit of the natives? Had they been\nperceived? Would their tracks betray them?\n\nAt this moment the lower strata of vapor rose, enveloping them for an\ninstant in a moist cloud, and they discerned, three hundred feet below\nthem, the frantic crowd of savages.\n\nThey saw, but were also seen. Renewed yells resounded, mingled with\nbarks; and the whole tribe, after vainly endeavoring to climb the rock,\nrushed out of the inclosure and hastened by the shortest paths in\npursuit of the prisoners, who fled in terror from their vengeance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nTHE SACRED MOUNTAIN.\n\n\nThe summit of the mountain was a hundred feet higher. It was important\nfor the fugitives to reach it, that they might conceal themselves from\nthe sight of the Maoris, on the opposite slope. They hoped that some\npracticable ridge would then enable them to gain the neighboring peaks.\nThe ascent was, therefore, hastened, as the threatening cries came\nnearer and nearer. The pursuers had reached the foot of the mountain.\n\n\"Courage, courage, my friends!\" cried Glenarvan, urging his companions\nwith word and gesture.\n\n[Sidenote: A SCENE OF ENCHANTMENT.]\n\nIn less than five minutes they reached the top of the mountain. Here\nthey turned around to consider their situation, and take some route by\nwhich they might evade the Maoris.\n\nFrom this height the prospect commanded Lake Taupo, which extended\ntowards the west in its picturesque frame of hills. To the north rose\nthe peaks of Pirongia; to the south the flaming crater of Tongariro.\nBut towards the east the view was limited by a barrier of peaks and\nridges.\n\nGlenarvan cast an anxious glance around him. The mist had dissolved\nunder the rays of the sun, and his eye could clearly distinguish the\nleast depressions of the earth. No movement of the Maoris could escape\nhis sight.\n\nThe natives were not five hundred feet distant, when they reached the\nplateau upon which the solitary peak rested. Glenarvan could not, for\never so short a time, delay longer. At all hazards they must fly, at\nthe risk of being hemmed in on all sides.\n\n\"Let us go down,\" cried he, \"before our only way of escape is blocked\nup.\"\n\nBut just as the ladies rose by a final effort, MacNabb stopped them,\nand said:\n\n\"It is useless, Glenarvan. Look!\"\n\nAnd all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the\nmovements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted.\nTheir ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious\ninterdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and\nhalted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock.\n\nAll the savages, thirsting for blood, were now ranged along the foot\nof the mountain, yelling, gesticulating, and brandishing guns and\nhatchets; but they did not advance a single foot. Their dogs, like\nthemselves, as though chained to earth, howled with rage.\n\nWhat was the difficulty? What invisible power restrained the natives?\nThe fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that\nenchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to\nturn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak.\n\n\"The tomb of the chief Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\"\n\nRobert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the\nmountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes.\nGlenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In\ntheir wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where\nKara-T\u00e9t\u00e9 had been buried.\n\nFollowed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the\nvery foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the\nentrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started\nback suddenly.\n\n\"A savage!\" said he.\n\n\"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb.\"\n\n\"What matter? Let us enter.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the\ninclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness\nof the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He\nappeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect\nindifference.\n\nGlenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him,\nsaid, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English:\n\n\"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"\n\nIt was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with\nwonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety\nwas represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished\nto know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan\nchecked this unseasonable curiosity.\n\n[Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"]\n\n\"The savages!\" said he.\n\n\"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are\nindividuals whom I supremely despise.\"\n\n\"But can they not----?\"\n\n\"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\"\n\nEach followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the\nsame place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible\ncries.\n\n\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"", "\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the\nmountain is tabooed.\"\n\n\"Tabooed?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of\nthose asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\"\n\nIndeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become\ninaccessible by the superstitious savages.\n\nThe safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a\nsalutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken. In two days we shall be beyond the\nreach of these rascals.\"\n\n\"We will escape!\" said Glenarvan; \"but how?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Paganel, \"but we will do so all the same.\"\n\nAll now wished to hear the geographer's adventures. Strangely enough,\nin the case of a man loquacious usually, it was necessary to draw,\nas it were, the words from his mouth. He, who was so fond of telling\nstories, replied only in an evasive way to the questions of his friends.\n\n\"Paganel has changed,\" thought MacNabb.\n\n[Sidenote: THE WORTH OF SPECTACLES.]\n\nIndeed, the countenance of the geographer was no longer the same. He\nwrapped himself gloomily in his great flaxen mantle, and seemed to shun\ntoo inquisitive looks. However, when they were all seated around him at\nthe foot of the tomb, he related his experiences.\n\nAfter the death of Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9, Paganel had taken advantage, like Robert,\nof the confusion of the natives, and escaped from the pah. But less\nfortunate than young Grant, he had fallen upon an encampment of Maoris,\nwho were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance,\nwho was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe. This chief\nspoke English accurately, and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose\nagainst that of the geographer. Paganel wondered whether he should\nconsider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step\nwithout being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how\nmatters stood on this point.\n\nThe chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night.\n\nThis novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends.\n\nFortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends.\n\nSuch was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent.\n\nTheir situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise.\n\nAnd first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris.\n\nBut this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross.\n\nGlenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them. They were made of printed\npaper. Paganel picked them up out of curiosity, but it was difficult to\ndecipher them.\n\n[Sidenote: A STRANGE COLPORTEUR.]\n\n\"Why!\" said he, \"do you know, my friends, what these creatures use for\nwads in their guns?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"Leaves of the Bible! If this is the use they make of the sacred\nwritings, I pity the missionaries. They will have difficulty in\nfounding Maori libraries.\"\n\n\"And what passage of the Scriptures have these natives fired at us?\"\nasked Glenarvan.\n\n\"A mighty promise of God,\" replied Captain Mangles, who had also read\nthe paper. \"It bids us hope in Him,\" added the young captain, with the\nunshaken conviction of his Scottish faith.\n\n\"Read, John,\" said Glenarvan.\n\nHe read this line, which had so strangely reached them:\n\n\"Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him:\"\nPsalm xci. I.\n\n\"My friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"we must make known the words of hope to\nour brave and dear ladies. Here is something to reanimate their hearts.\"\n\nGlenarvan and his companions ascended the steep paths of the peak, and\nproceeded towards the tomb, which they wished to examine. On the way\nthey were astonished to feel, at short intervals, a certain trembling\nof the ground. It was not an irregular agitation, but that continued\nvibration which the sides of a boiler undergo when it is fully charged.\nSteam, in large quantities, generated by the action of subterranean\nfires, seemed to be working beneath the crust of the mountain.\n\nThis peculiarity could not astonish people who had passed between the\nwarm springs of the Waikato. They knew that this region of Ika-Na-Maoui\nis volcanic. It is like a sieve, from the holes of which ever issue the\nvapors of subterranean laboratories.\n\nPaganel, who had already observed this, called the attention of his\nfriends to the circumstance. The Maunganamu is only one of those\nnumerous cones that cover the central portion of the island. The least\nmechanical action could provoke the formation of a crater in the clayey\nsoil.\n\n\"And yet,\" said Glenarvan, \"we seem to be in no more danger here than\nbeside the boiler of the Duncan. This crust is firm.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied the major; \"but a boiler, however strong it may\nbe, will always burst at last after too long use.\"\n\n\"MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"I do not desire to remain on this peak. Let\nHeaven show me a way of escape, and I will leave it instantly.\"\n\nLady Helena, who perceived Lord Glenarvan, now approached.\n\n\"My dear Edward,\" said she, \"you have considered our position! Are we\nto hope or fear?\"\n\n\"Hope, my dear Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"The natives will never come\nto the top of the mountain, and we shall have abundant time to form a\nplan of escape.\"\n\n\"Moreover, madam,\" said Captain Mangles, \"God himself encourages us to\nhope.\"\n\nSo saying, he gave her the text of the Bible which had been sent to\nthem. She and Mary Grant, whose confiding soul was always open to\nthe ministrations of Heaven, saw, in the words of the Holy Book, an\ninfallible pledge of safety.\n\n\"Now to the tomb!\" cried Paganel, gayly. \"This is our fortress, our\ncastle, our dining-room, and our workshop. No one is to disarrange it.\nLadies, permit me to do the honors of this charming dwelling.\"\n\nAll followed the good-natured Paganel. When the savages saw the\nfugitives desecrate anew this tabooed sepulchre, they fired numerous\nvolleys, and uttered yells no less terrible. But fortunately their\nbullets could not reach as far as their cries, for they only came\nhalf-way, while their vociferations were lost in empty air.\n\n[Sidenote: BOARD AND LODGING.]\n\nLady Helena, Mary Grant, and their companions, quite reassured at\nseeing that the superstition of the Maoris was still stronger than\ntheir rage, entered the tomb. It was a palisade of red painted stakes.\nSymbolical faces, a real tattooing on wood, described the nobleness\nand exploits of the deceased. Strings of pipes, shells, and carved\nstones extended from one stake to another. Inside, the earth was hidden\nbeneath a carpet of green leaves. In the centre a slight protuberance\nmarked the freshly-made grave. Here reposed the weapons of the chief,\nhis guns loaded and primed, his lance, his splendid hatchet of green\njade, with a supply of powder and balls sufficient for the hunts of the\nother world.\n\n\"Here is a whole arsenal,\" said Paganel, \"of which we will make a\nbetter use than the deceased. It is a good idea of these savages to\ncarry their weapons to heaven with them.\"\n\n\"But these are English guns!\" said the major.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" replied Glenarvan; \"it is a very foolish custom to make\npresents of fire-arms to the savages, who then use them against the\ninvaders, and with reason. At all events, these guns will be useful to\nus.\"\n\n\"But still more useful,\" said Paganel, \"will be the provisions and\nwater intended for Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9.\"", "\"But still more useful,\" said Paganel, \"will be the provisions and\nwater intended for Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9.\"\n\nThe parents and friends of the dead had, indeed, faithfully fulfilled\ntheir duties. The amount of food testified their esteem for the virtues\nof the chief. There were provisions enough to last ten persons fifteen\ndays, or rather the deceased for eternity. They consisted of ferns,\nsweet yams, and potatoes, which were introduced some time before by the\nEuropeans. Tall vases of fresh water stood near, and a dozen baskets,\nartistically woven, contained numerous tablets of green gum.\n\nThe fugitives were, therefore, fortified for several days against\nhunger and thirst, and they needed no urging to take their first meal\nat the chief's expense. Glenarvan directed Mr. Olbinett's attention\nto the food necessary for his companions; but he, with his usual\nexactness, even in critical situations, thought the bill of fare rather\nscanty. Moreover, he did not know how to prepare the roots, and there\nwas no fire.\n\nBut Paganel solved the difficulty, and advised him to simply bury his\nferns and potatoes in the ground itself, for the heat of the upper\nstrata was very great. Olbinett, however, narrowly escaped a serious\nscalding, for, just as he had dug a hole to put his roots in, a stream\nof watery vapor burst forth, and rose to the height of several feet.\nThe steward started back in terror.\n\n\"Close the hole!\" cried the major, who, with the aid of the two\nsailors, covered the orifice with fragments of pumice-stone, while\nPaganel murmured these words:\n\n\"Well! well! ha! ha! very natural!\"\n\n\"You are not scalded?\" inquired MacNabb of Olbinett.\n\n\"No, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied the steward; \"but I scarcely expected----\"\n\n\"So many blessings,\" added Paganel, in a mirthful tone. \"Consider\nKara-T\u00e9t\u00e9's water and provisions, and the fire of the earth! This\nmountain is a paradise! I propose that we found a colony here,\ncultivate the soil, and settle for the rest of our days. We will\nbe Robinson Crusoes of Maunganamu. Indeed, I look in vain for any\ndeficiency on this comfortable peak.\"\n\n\"Nothing is wanting if the earth is firm,\" replied Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Well, it was not created yesterday,\" said Paganel. \"It has long\nresisted the action of internal fires, and will easily hold out till\nour departure.\"\n\n\"Breakfast is ready,\" announced Mr. Olbinett, as gravely as if he had\nbeen performing his duties at Malcolm Castle.\n\nThe fugitives at once sat down near the palisade, and enjoyed the\nrepast that Providence had so opportunely furnished to them in this\ncritical situation. No one appeared particular about the choice of\nfood, but there was a diversity of opinion concerning the edible\nferns. Some found them sweet and pleasant, and others mucilaginous,\ninsipid, and acrid. The sweet potatoes, cooked in the hot earth, were\nexcellent.\n\n[Illustration: The steward started back in terror.]\n\nTheir hunger being satiated, Glenarvan proposed that they should,\nwithout delay, arrange a plan of escape.\n\n\"So soon!\" said Paganel, in a truly piteous tone. \"What! are you\nthinking already of leaving this delightful place?\"\n\n\"I think, first of all,\" replied Glenarvan, \"that we ought to attempt\nan escape before we are forced to it by hunger. We have strength enough\nyet, and must take advantage of it. To-night let us try to gain the\neastern valleys, and cross the circle of natives under cover of the\ndarkness.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" answered Paganel; \"if the Maoris will let us pass.\"\n\n\"And if they prevent us?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Then we will employ the great expedients,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"You have great expedients, then?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"More than I know what to do with,\" rejoined Paganel, without further\nexplanation.\n\nThey could now do nothing but wait for night to attempt crossing\nthe line of savages, who had not left their position. Their ranks\neven seemed increased by stragglers from the tribe. Here and there\nfreshly-kindled fires formed a flaming girdle around the base of the\npeak. When darkness had invaded the surrounding valleys, the Maunganamu\nseemed to rise from a vast conflagration, while its summit was lost in\na dense shade. Six hundred feet below were heard the tumult and cries\nof the enemy's camp.\n\nAt nine o'clock it was very dark, and Glenarvan and Captain Mangles\nresolved to make an exploration before taking their companions on\nthis perilous journey. They noiselessly descended the declivity some\ndistance, and reached the narrow ridge that crossed the line of natives\nfifty feet above the encampment.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER SUNRISE.]\n\nAll went well so far. The Maoris, stretched beside their fires, did not\nseem to perceive the two fugitives, who advanced a few paces farther.\nBut suddenly, to the left and right of the ridge, a double volley\nresounded.\n\n\"Back!\" cried Glenarvan; \"these bandits have eyes like a cat, and the\nguns of riflemen!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles and he reascended at once the precipitous slopes of the\nmountain, and speedily assured their terrified friends of their safety.\nGlenarvan's hat had been pierced by two bullets. It was, therefore,\ndangerous to venture on the ridge between these two lines of marksmen.\n\n\"Wait till to-morrow,\" said Paganel; \"and since we cannot deceive the\nvigilance of these natives, permit me to give them a dose in my own\nway.\"\n\nThe temperature was quite cold. Fortunately, Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9 wore in the tomb\nhis best night-robes, warm, flaxen coverings, in which each one wrapped\nhimself without hesitation; and soon the fugitives, protected by the\nnative superstition, slept peacefully in the shelter of the palisades,\non the earth that seemed to quake with the internal commotion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nA BOLD STRATAGEM.\n\n\nThe rising sun awakened with his first rays the sleepers on the\nMaunganamu. The Maoris for some time had been moving to and fro at the\nfoot of the peak without wandering from their post of observation.\nFurious cries saluted the appearance of the Europeans as they issued\nfrom the desecrated tomb.\n\nEach cast a longing glance towards the surrounding mountains, the deep\nvalleys, still veiled in mist, and the surface of Lake Taupo, gently\nrippling beneath the morning wind. Then all, eager to know Paganel's\nnew project, gathered around him with questioning looks; while the\ngeographer at once satisfied the restless curiosity of his companions.\n\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"my project has this advantage, that if it does\nnot produce the result that I expect, or even fails, our situation will\nnot be impaired. But it ought to and will succeed.\"\n\n\"And this project?\" asked the major.\n\n\"This is it,\" replied Paganel. \"The superstition of the natives has\nmade this mountain a place of refuge, and this superstition must help\nus to escape. If I succeed in convincing Kai-Koumou that we have become\nthe victims of our sacrilege, that the wrath of Heaven has fallen upon\nus, in short, that we have met a terrible death, do you think that he\nwill abandon the mountain and return to his village?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"And with what horrible death do you threaten us?\" inquired Lady Helena.\n\n\"The death of the sacrilegious, my friends,\" continued Paganel. \"The\navenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them.\"\n\n\"What! you would make a volcano?\" cried Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes, a factitious, an improvised one, whose fury we will control.\nThere is quite a supply of vapors and subterranean fires that only\nask for an outlet. Let us arrange an artificial eruption for our own\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"The idea is good,\" said the major, \"and well conceived, Paganel.\"\n\n\"You understand,\" resumed the geographer, \"that we are to feign being\nconsumed by the flames of Pluto, and shall disappear spiritually in the\ntomb of Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A VOLCANO IN MINIATURE.]\n\n\"Where we shall remain three, four, or five days, if necessary, till\nthe savages are convinced of our death, and abandon the siege.\"\n\n\"But if they think of making sure of our destruction,\" said Miss Grant,\n\"and climb the mountain?\"\n\n\"No, my dear Mary,\" replied Paganel, \"they will not do that. The\nmountain is tabooed, and if it shall itself devour its profaners the\ntaboo will be still more rigorous.\"\n\n\"This plan is really well conceived,\" remarked Glenarvan. \"There is\nonly one chance against it, and that is, that the savages may persist\nin remaining at the foot of the mountain till the provisions fail\nus. But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part\nskillfully.\"\n\n\"And when shall we make this last venture?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"This very evening,\" answered Paganel, \"at the hour of the greatest\ndarkness.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said MacNabb. \"Paganel, you are a man of genius; and although\nfrom habit I am scarcely ever enthusiastic, I will answer for your\nsuccess. Ha! these rascals! we shall perform a little miracle for them\nthat will delay their conversion a good century. May the missionaries\npardon us!\"\n\nPaganel's plan was therefore adopted, and really, with the\nsuperstitious notions of the Maoris, it might and ought to succeed.\nIt only remained to execute it. The idea was good, but in practice\ndifficult. Might not this volcano consume the audacious ones who should\ndig the crater? Could they control and direct this eruption when the\nvapors, flames, and lava should be let loose? Would it not engulf\nthe entire peak in a flood of fire? They were tampering with those\nphenomena whose absolute control is reserved for forces higher than\ntheirs.\n\nPaganel had foreseen these difficulties, but he expected to act\nprudently, and not to venture to extremes. An illusion was enough to\ndeceive the Maoris, without the awful reality of a large eruption.", "How long that day seemed! Each one counted the interminable hours.\nEverything was prepared for flight. The provisions of the tomb had\nbeen divided, and made into convenient bundles. Several mats, and the\nfire-arms, which had been found in the tomb of the chief, formed light\nbaggage. Of course these preparations were made within the palisaded\ninclosure and unknown to the savages.\n\nAt six o'clock the steward served a farewell feast. Where and when they\nshould eat in the valleys no one could foretell.\n\nTwilight came on. The sun disappeared behind a bank of dense clouds of\nthreatening aspect. A few flashes illumined the horizon, and a distant\npeal of thunder rumbled along the vault of the sky. Paganel welcomed\nthe storm that came to the aid of his design.\n\nAt eight o'clock the summit of the mountain was hidden by a foreboding\ndarkness, while the sky looked terribly black, as if for a background\nto the flaming outbreak that Paganel was about to inaugurate. The\nMaoris could no longer see their prisoners. The time for action had\ncome. Rapidity was necessary, and Glenarvan, Paganel, MacNabb, Robert,\nthe steward, and the two sailors at once set to work vigorously.\n\nThe place for the crater was chosen thirty paces from Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9's tomb.\nIt was important that this structure should be spared by the eruption,\nfor otherwise the taboo would become ineffective. Paganel had observed\nan enormous block of stone, around which the vapors seemed to pour\nforth with considerable force. This rocky mass covered a small natural\ncrater in the peak, and only by its weight prevented the escape of the\nsubterranean flames. If they could succeed in overturning it, the smoke\nand lava would immediately issue through the unobstructed opening.\n\n[Sidenote: VULCANS AT WORK.]\n\nThe fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes of the tomb, and\nwith these they vigorously attacked the ponderous mass. Under their\nunited efforts the rock was not long in moving. They dug a sort of\ngroove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an\ninclined plane.\n\nAs their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more\nviolent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which glided down the slope of\nthe mountain and disappeared.\n\nThe thin covering at once yielded. An incandescent column poured forth\ntowards the sky with loud explosions, while streams of boiling water\nand lava rolled towards the encampment of the natives and the valleys\nbelow. The whole peak trembled, and you might almost have thought that\nit was disappearing in a general conflagration.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had scarcely time to escape the shock of\nthe eruption. They fled to the inclosure of the tomb, but not without\nreceiving a few scalding drops of the water, which bubbled and exhaled\na strong sulphureous odor.\n\nThen mud, lava, and volcanic fragments mingled in the scene of\ndevastation. Torrents of flame furrowed the sides of the Maunganamu.\nThe adjoining mountains glowed in the light of the eruption, and the\ndeep valleys were illumined with a vivid brightness.\n\nThe savages were soon aroused, both by the noise and the heat\nof the lava that flowed in a scalding tide through the midst of\ntheir encampment. Those whom the fiery flood had not reached fled,\nand ascended the surrounding hills, turning and gazing back at\nthis terrific phenomenon, with which their god, in his wrath, had\noverwhelmed the desecrators of the sacred mountain; while at certain\nmoments they were heard howling their consecratory cry:\n\n\"Taboo! taboo! taboo!\"\n\n[Illustration: The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes\nof the tomb.]\n\n[Illustration: An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with\nloud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards\nthe encampment of the natives.]\n\nMeantime an enormous quantity of vapor, melted stones, and lava had\nescaped from the crater. It was no longer a simple geyser. All this\nvolcanic effervescence had hitherto been confined beneath the crust of\nthe peak, since the outlets of Tangariro sufficed for its expansion;\nbut as a new opening had been made, it had rushed forth with extreme\nviolence.\n\nAll night long, during the storm that raged above and below, the peak\nwas shaken with a commotion that could not but alarm Glenarvan. The\nprisoners, concealed behind the palisade of the tomb, watched the\nfearful progress of the outbreak.\n\nMorning came. The fury of the volcano had not moderated. Thick,\nyellowish vapors mingled with the flames, and torrents of lava poured\nin every direction. Glenarvan, with eye alert and beating heart,\nglanced between the interstices of the inclosure, and surveyed the camp\nof the Maoris.\n\nThe natives had fled to the neighboring plateaus, beyond the reach of\nthe volcano. Several corpses, lying at the foot of the peak, had been\ncharred by the fire. Farther on, towards the pah, the lava had consumed\na number of huts, that were still smoking. The savages, in scattered\ngroups, were gazing at the vapory summit of Maunganamu with religious\nawe.\n\nKai-Koumou came into the midst of his warriors, and Glenarvan\nrecognized him. The chief advanced to the base of the peak, on the side\nspared by the eruption, but did not cross the first slopes. Here, with\noutstretched arms, like a sorcerer exorcising, he made a few grimaces,\nthe meaning of which did not escape the prisoners. As Paganel had\nforeseen, Kai-Koumou was invoking upon the mountain a more rigorous\ntaboo.\n\nSoon after, the natives descended, in single file, the winding paths\nthat led towards the pah.\n\n[Sidenote: A WEARY WAITING.]\n\n\"They are going!\" cried Glenarvan. \"They are abandoning their post!\nGod be thanked! Our scheme has succeeded! My dear Helena, my brave\ncompanions, we are now dead and buried; but this evening we will\nrevive, we will leave our tomb, and flee from these barbarous tribes!\"\n\nIt would be difficult to describe the joy that reigned within the\npalisade. Hope had reanimated all hearts. These courageous travelers\nforgot their past trials, dreaded not the future, and only rejoiced in\ntheir present deliverance; although very little reflection would show\nhow difficult was the task of reaching an European settlement from\ntheir present position. But if Kai-Koumou was outwitted, they believed\nthemselves safe from all the savages of New Zealand.\n\nA whole day must pass before the decisive attempt could be made, and\nthey employed their time in arranging a plan of escape. Paganel had\npreserved his map of New Zealand, and could therefore search out the\nsafest routes.\n\nAfter some discussion, the fugitives resolved to proceed eastward\ntowards the Bay of Plenty. This course would lead them through\ndistricts that were very rarely visited. The travelers, who were\nalready accustomed to overcoming natural difficulties, only feared\nmeeting the Maoris. They therefore determined to avoid them at all\nhazards, and gain the eastern coast, where the missionaries have\nfounded several establishments. Moreover, this portion of the island\nhad hitherto escaped the ravages of the war and the depredations of the\nnatives. As for the distance that separated Lake Taupo from the Bay of\nPlenty, it could not be more than one hundred miles. Ten days would\nsuffice for the journey. The missions once reached, they could rest\nthere, and wait for some favorable opportunity of gaining Auckland,\ntheir destination.\n\nThese points being settled, they continued to watch the savages till\nevening. Not one of them remained at the foot of the mountain, and\nwhen darkness invaded the valleys of the lake, no fire betokened the\npresence of the Maoris at the base of the peak. The coast was clear.\n\nAt nine o'clock it was dark night, and Glenarvan gave the signal for\ndeparture. His companions and he, armed and equipped at Kara-T\u00e9t\u00e9's\nexpense, began to cautiously descend the slopes of the Maunganamu.\nCaptain Mangles and Wilson led the way, with eyes and ears on the\nalert. They stopped at the least sound,--they examined the faintest\nlight; each slid down the declivity, the better to elude detection.\n\nTwo hundred feet below the summit, Captain Mangles and his sailor\nreached the dangerous ridge that had been so obstinately guarded by the\nnatives. If, unfortunately, the Maoris, more crafty than the fugitives,\nhad feigned a retreat to entice them within reach, if they had not\nbeen deceived by the eruption, their presence would be discovered\nat this point. Glenarvan, in spite of his confidence and Paganel's\npleasantries, could not help trembling. The safety of his friends was\nat stake during the few moments necessary to cross the ridge. He felt\nLady Helena's heart beat as she clung to his arm.\n\nBut neither he nor Captain Mangles thought of retreating. The young\ncaptain, followed by the others, and favored by the dense obscurity,\ncrawled along the narrow path, only stopping when some detached stone\nrolled to the base of the mountain. If the savages were still in\nambush, these unusual sounds would provoke from each side a formidable\nvolley.\n\nHowever, in gliding like serpents along this inclined crest, the\nfugitives could not advance rapidly. When Captain Mangles had gained\nthe lowest part, scarcely twenty-five feet separated him from the\nplain where the natives had encamped the night before. Here the ridge\nascended quite steeply towards a coppice about a quarter of a mile\ndistant.\n\n[Sidenote: TABOOED NO LONGER.]", "[Sidenote: TABOOED NO LONGER.]\n\nThe travelers crossed this place without accident, and began the\nascent in silence. The thicket was invisible, but they knew where it\nwas, and, provided no ambuscade was laid there, Glenarvan hoped to\nfind a secure refuge. However, he remembered that they were now no\nlonger protected by the taboo. The ascending ridge did not belong to\nthe sacred mountain, but to a chain that ran along the eastern shores\nof Lake Taupo. Therefore not only the shots of the savages, but also a\nhand-to-hand conflict, were to be feared.\n\nFor a short time the little party slowly mounted towards the upper\nelevations. The captain could not yet discern the dark coppice, but it\ncould not be more than two hundred feet distant.\n\nSuddenly he stopped, and almost recoiled. He thought he heard some\nsound in the darkness. His hesitation arrested the advance of his\ncompanions.\n\nHe stood motionless long enough to alarm those who followed him. With\nwhat agonizing suspense they waited could not be described. Would they\nbe forced to return to the summit of the mountain?\n\nBut, finding that the noise was not repeated, their leader continued\nhis ascent along the narrow path. The coppice was soon dimly defined\nin the gloom. In a few moments it was reached, and the fugitives were\ncrouching beneath the thick foliage of the trees.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nFROM PERIL TO SAFETY.\n\n\nDarkness favored the escape; and making the greatest possible progress,\nthey left the fatal regions of Lake Taupo. Paganel assumed the guidance\nof the little party, and his marvelous instinct as a traveler was\ndisplayed anew during this perilous journey. He managed with surprising\ndexterity in the thick gloom, chose unhesitatingly the almost invisible\npaths, and kept constantly an undeviating course.\n\nAt nine o'clock in the morning they had accomplished a considerable\ndistance, and could not reasonably require more of the courageous\nladies. Besides, the place seemed suitable for an encampment. The\nfugitives had reached the ravine that separates the Kaimanawa and\nWahiti ranges. The road on the right ran southward to Oberland.\nPaganel, with his map in his hand, made a turn to the northeast, and\nat ten o'clock the little party had reached a sort of steep buttress,\nformed by a spur of the mountain.\n\nThe provisions were taken from the sacks, and all did ample justice to\nthem. Mary Grant and the major, who had not hitherto been very well\nsatisfied with the edible ferns, made this time a hearty meal of them.\nThey rested here till two o'clock in the afternoon, then the journey\ntowards the east was resumed, and at evening the travelers encamped\neight miles from the mountains. They needed no urging to sleep in the\nopen air.\n\nThe next day very serious difficulties were encountered. They were\nforced to pass through a curious region of volcanic lakes and geysers\nthat extends eastward from the Wahiti ranges. It was pleasing to the\neye, but fatiguing to the limbs. Every quarter of a mile there were\nobstacles, turns, and windings, far too many for rapid progress; but\nwhat strange appearances and what infinite variety does nature give to\nher grand scenes!\n\n[Sidenote: ALMOST TIRED OUT!]\n\nOver this expanse of twenty square miles the overflow of subterranean\nforces was displayed in every form. Salt springs, of a singular\ntransparency, teeming with myriads of insects, issued from the porous\nground. They exhaled a penetrating odor, and deposited on the earth a\nwhite coating like dazzling snow. Their waters, though clear, were\nat the boiling-point, while other neighboring springs poured forth\nice-cold streams. On every side water-spouts, with spiral rings of\nvapor, spirted from the ground like the jets of a fountain, some\ncontinuous, others intermittent, as if controlled by some capricious\nsprite. They rose like an amphitheatre, in natural terraces one above\nanother, their vapors gradually mingling in wreaths of white smoke; and\nflowing down the semi-transparent steps of these gigantic staircases,\nthey fed the lakes with their boiling cascades.\n\nIt will be needless to dilate upon the incidents of the journey, which\nwere neither numerous nor important. Their way led through forests and\nover plains. The captain took his bearings by the sun and stars. The\nsky, which was quite clear, was sparing of heat and rain. Still, an\nincreasing weariness delayed the travelers, already so cruelly tried,\nand they had to make great efforts to reach their destination.\n\nHowever, they still conversed together, but no longer in common. The\nlittle party was divided into groups, not by any narrow prejudice or\nill feeling, but to some extent from sadness. Often Glenarvan was\nalone, thinking, as he approached the coast, of the Duncan and her\ncrew. He forgot the dangers that still threatened him, in his grief for\nhis lost sailors and the terrible visions that continually haunted his\nmind.\n\nThey no longer spoke of Harry Grant. And why should they, since they\ncould do nothing for him? If the captain's name was ever pronounced, it\nwas in the conversations of his daughter and her betrothed. The young\ncaptain had not reminded her of what she had said to him on the last\nnight of their captivity on the mountain. His magnanimity would not\ntake advantage of words uttered in a moment of supreme despair.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCOMPLISHING THE LAST STAGE.]\n\nWhen he did speak of Captain Grant, he began to lay plans for a further\nsearch. He declared to Mary that Lord Glenarvan would resume this\nundertaking, hitherto so unsuccessful.\n\n[Illustration: On every side water-spouts, with spiral rings of vapor,\nspirted from the ground like the jets of a fountain.]\n\nHe maintained that the authenticity of the document could not be\ndoubted. Her father must, therefore, be somewhere; and though it were\nnecessary to search the whole world, they were sure to find him. The\nyoung girl was cheered by these words; and both, bound by the same\nthoughts, now sympathized in the same hope. Lady Helena often took part\nin the conversation, and was very careful not to discourage the young\npeople with any sad forebodings.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, after many vicissitudes, reached the foot\nof Mount Ikirangi, whose peak towered five thousand feet aloft. They\nhad now traveled almost one hundred miles since leaving the Maunganamu,\nand the coast was still thirty miles distant. Captain Mangles had\nhoped to make the journey in ten days, but he was ignorant then of\nthe difficulties of the way. There were still two good days of travel\nbefore they could gain the ocean, and renewed activity and extreme\nvigilance became necessary, for they were entering a region frequented\nby the natives. However, each conquered the fatigue, and the little\nparty continued their course.\n\nBetween Mount Ikirangi, some distance on their right, and Mount Hardy,\nwhose summit rose to the left, was a large plain, thickly overspread\nwith twining plants and underbrush. Progress here was tedious and\ndifficult in the extreme; for the pliant tendrils wound a score of\nfolds about their bodies like serpents. Hunting was impossible; the\nprovisions were nearly exhausted, and could not be renewed, and water\nfailed, so that they could not allay their thirst, rendered doubly\nacute by their fatigue. The sufferings of Glenarvan and his friends\nwere terrible, and for the first time their moral energy now almost\nforsook them.\n\nAt last, dragging themselves along, wearied to the utmost degree in\nbody, almost despairing in mind, they reached Lottin Point, on the\nshores of the Pacific.\n\nAt this place several deserted huts were seen, the ruins of a village\nrecently devastated by the war; around them were abandoned fields, and\neverywhere the traces of plunder and conflagration. But here fate had\nreserved a new and fearful test for the unfortunate travelers.\n\nThey were walking along the coast, when, at no great distance, a number\nof natives appeared, who rushed towards the little party, brandishing\ntheir weapons. Glenarvan, shut in by the sea, saw that escape was\nimpossible, and, summoning all his strength, was about to make\npreparations for battle, when Captain Mangles cried:\n\n\"A canoe! a canoe!\"\n\nAnd truly, twenty paces distant, a canoe, with six oars, was lying on\nthe beach. To rush to it, set it afloat, and fly from this dangerous\nplace was the work of an instant; the whole party seemed to receive at\nonce a fresh accession of bodily strength and mental vigor.\n\nIn ten minutes the boat was at a considerable distance. The sea was\ncalm. The captain, however, not wishing to wander too far from the\ncoast, was about to give the order to cruise along the shore, when he\nsuddenly ceased rowing. He had observed three canoes starting from\nLottin Point, with the evident intention of overtaking and capturing\nthe unfortunate fugitives.\n\n\"To sea! to sea!\" cried he; \"better perish in the waves than be\ncaptured!\"\n\nThe canoe, under the strokes of its four oarsmen, at once put to sea,\nand for some time kept its distance. But the strength of the weakened\nfugitives soon grew less, and their pursuers gradually gained upon\nthem. The boats were now scarcely a mile apart. There was therefore\nno possibility of avoiding the attack of the natives, who, armed with\ntheir long guns, were already preparing to fire.\n\n[Sidenote: DEATH ON EVERY HAND.]\n\nWhat was Glenarvan doing? Standing at the stern of the canoe, he looked\naround as if for some expected aid. What did he expect? What did he\nwish? Had he a presentiment?\n\nAll at once his face brightened, his hand was stretched towards an\nindistinct object.\n\n\"A ship!\" cried he; \"my friends, a ship! Row, row!\"\n\nNot one of the four oarsmen turned to see this unexpected vessel,\nfor they must not lose a stroke. Only Paganel, rising, directed his\ntelescope towards the place indicated.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"a ship, a steamer, under full headway, coming towards\nus! Courage, captain!\"", "\"Yes,\" said he, \"a ship, a steamer, under full headway, coming towards\nus! Courage, captain!\"\n\nThe fugitives displayed new energy, and for several moments longer they\nkept their distance. The steamer grew more and more distinct. They\ncould clearly discern her masts, and the thick clouds of black smoke\nthat issued from her smoke-stack. Glenarvan, giving the helm to Robert,\nhad seized the geographer's glass, and did not lose a single movement\nof the vessel.\n\nBut what were Captain Mangles and his companions to think when they\nsaw the expression of his features change, his face grow pale, and the\ninstrument fall from his hands. A single word explained this sudden\nemotion.\n\n\"The Duncan!\" cried Glenarvan,--\"the Duncan and the convicts!\"\n\n\"The Duncan?\" repeated the captain, dropping his oar and rising.\n\n\"Yes, death on all sides!\" moaned Glenarvan, overcome by so many\ncalamities.\n\nIt was indeed the yacht--without a doubt,--the yacht, with her crew of\nbandits! The major could not repress a malediction. This was too much.\n\nMeantime the canoe was floating at random. Whither should they guide\nit, whither flee? Was it possible to choose between the savages and the\nconvicts?\n\n[Illustration: A second ball whistled over their heads, and demolished\nthe nearest of the three canoes.]\n\n[Sidenote: A MYSTERIOUS PRESERVATION.]\n\nJust then a shot came from the native boat, that had approached nearer.\nThe bullet struck Wilson's oar; but his companions still propelled\nthe canoe towards the Duncan. The yacht was advancing at full speed,\nand was only half a mile distant. Captain Mangles, beset on all sides,\nno longer knew how to act, or in what direction to escape. The two poor\nladies were on their knees, praying in their despair.\n\nThe savages were now firing a continued volley, and the bullets rained\naround the canoe. Just then a sharp report sounded, and a ball from the\nyacht's cannon passed over the heads of the fugitives, who remained\nmotionless between the fire of the Duncan and the natives.\n\nCaptain Mangles, frantic with despair, seized his hatchet. He was on\nthe point of sinking their own canoe, with his unfortunate companions,\nwhen a cry from Robert stopped him.\n\n\"Tom Austin! Tom Austin!\" said the child. \"He is on board! I see him!\nHe has recognized us! He is waving his hat!\"\n\nThe hatchet was suspended in mid-air. A second ball whistled over\ntheir heads, and demolished the nearest of the three canoes, while a\nloud hurrah was heard on board the Duncan. The savages fled in terror\ntowards the coast.\n\n\"Help, help, Tom!\" cried Captain Mangles, in a piercing voice. And\na few moments afterwards the ten fugitives, without knowing how, or\nscarcely comprehending this unexpected good fortune, were all in safety\non board the Duncan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nWHY THE DUNCAN WENT TO NEW ZEALAND.\n\n\nThe feelings of Glenarvan and his friends, when the songs of old\nScotland resounded in their ears, it is impossible to describe. As soon\nas they set foot on deck the bagpiper struck up a well remembered air,\nwhile hearty hurrahs welcomed the owner's return on board. Glenarvan,\nJohn Mangles, Paganel, Robert, and even the major, wept and embraced\neach other. Their emotions rose from joy to ecstasy. The geographer was\nfairly wild, skipping about and watching with his inseparable telescope\nthe canoes returning to shore.\n\nBut at sight of Glenarvan and his companions, with tattered garments,\nemaciated features, and the traces of extreme suffering, the crew\nceased their lively demonstrations. These were spectres, not the bold\nand dashing travelers whom, three months before, hope had stimulated to\na search for the shipwrecked captain. Chance alone had led them back to\nthis vessel that they had ceased to regard as theirs, and in what a sad\nstate of exhaustion and feebleness!\n\nHowever, before thinking of fatigue, or the imperative calls of hunger\nand thirst, Glenarvan questioned Tom Austin concerning his presence in\nthese waters. Why was the Duncan on the eastern coast of New Zealand?\nWhy was she not in the hands of Ben Joyce? By what providential working\nhad God restored her to the fugitives? These were the questions that\nwere hurriedly addressed to Tom Austin. The old sailor did not know\nwhich to answer first. He therefore concluded to listen only to Lord\nGlenarvan, and reply to him.\n\n\"But the convicts?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"What have you done with the\nconvicts?\"\n\n\"The convicts!\" replied Tom Austin, like a man who is at a loss to\nunderstand a question.\n\n\"Yes; the wretches who attacked the yacht.\"\n\n\"What yacht, my lord? The Duncan?\"\n\n\"Of course. Did not Ben Joyce come on board?\"\n\n\"I do not know Ben Joyce; I have never seen him.\"\n\n\"Never?\" cried Glenarvan, amazed at the answers of the old sailor.\n\"Then will you tell me why the Duncan is now on the shores of New\nZealand?\"\n\n[Sidenote: MYSTERY MORE MYSTERIOUS!]\n\nAlthough Glenarvan and his friends did not at all understand Austin's\nastonishment, what was their surprise when he replied, in a calm voice:\n\n\"The Duncan is here by your lordship's orders.\"\n\n\"By my orders?\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord. I only conformed to the instructions contained in your\nletter.\"\n\n\"My letter?\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\nThe ten travelers at once surrounded Tom Austin, and gazed at him in\neager curiosity. The letter written at the Snowy River had reached the\nDuncan.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"let us have an explanation; for I almost\nthink I am dreaming. You received a letter, Tom?\"\n\n\"Yes; a letter from your lordship.\"\n\n\"At Melbourne?\"\n\n\"At Melbourne; just as I had finished the repair of the ship.\"\n\n\"And this letter?\"\n\n\"It was not written by you; but it was signed by you, my lord.\"\n\n\"Exactly; it was sent by a convict, Ben Joyce.\"\n\n\"No; by the sailor called Ayrton, quartermaster of the Britannia.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ayrton or Ben Joyce; it is the same person. Well, what did the\nletter say?\"\n\n\"It ordered me to leave Melbourne without delay, and come to the\neastern shores of----\"\n\n\"Australia!\" cried Glenarvan, with an impetuosity that disconcerted the\nold sailor.\n\n\"Australia?\" repeated Tom, opening his eyes. \"No, indeed; New Zealand!\"\n\n\"Australia, Tom! Australia!\" replied Glenarvan's companions, with one\nvoice.\n\n[Illustration: As soon as they set foot on deck the bagpiper struck up\na well remembered air, while hearty hurrahs welcomed the owner's return\non board.]\n\nAustin was now bewildered. Glenarvan spoke with such assurance, that\nhe feared he had made a mistake in reading the letter. Could he,\nfaithful and accurate sailor that he was, have committed such a\nblunder? He began to feel troubled.\n\n[Illustration: This sally finished the poor geographer.]\n\n\n\"Be easy, Tom,\" said Lady Helena. \"Providence has decreed----\"\n\n\"No, madam, pardon me,\" returned the sailor; \"no, it is not possible! I\nam not mistaken. Ayrton also read the letter, and he, on the contrary,\nwished to go to Australia.\"\n\n\"Ayrton?\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"The very one. He maintained that it was a mistake, and that you had\nappointed Twofold Bay as the place of meeting.\"\n\n\"Have you the letter, Tom?\" asked the major, greatly puzzled.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Austin. \"I will soon bring it.\"\n\nHe accordingly repaired to his own cabin. While he was gone, they gazed\nat each other in silence, except the major, who, with his eye fixed\nupon Paganel, said, as he folded his arms:\n\n\"Indeed, I must confess, Paganel, that this is a little too much.\"\n\nAt this moment Austin returned. He held in his hand the letter written\nby Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan.\n\n\"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor.\n\nGlenarvan took the letter, and read:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of New Zealand.\"\n\n\"New Zealand?\" cried Paganel, starting.\n\nHe snatched the letter from Glenarvan's hands, rubbed his eyes,\nadjusted his spectacles to his nose, and read in his turn.\n\n\"New Zealand!\" repeated he, in an indescribable tone, while the letter\nslipped from his fingers.\n\nJust then he felt a hand fall upon his shoulder. He turned, and found\nhimself face to face with the major.\n\n[Sidenote: PAGANEL IN THE WITNESS-BOX.]\n\n\"Well, my good Paganel,\" said MacNabb, in a grave tone, \"it is\nfortunate that you did not send the Duncan to Cochin-China.\"\n\nThis sally finished the poor geographer. A fit of laughter seized the\nwhole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his\nhands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his\nfrenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer.\n\n\"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid. I acknowledge that your\nabsent-mindedness has been providential. To be sure, without you the\nDuncan would have fallen into the hands of the convicts; without you we\nshould have been recaptured by the Maoris. But do tell me, what strange\nassociation of ideas, what unnatural aberration, induced you to write\nNew Zealand instead of Australia?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Paganel. \"It was----\"\n\nBut at that moment his eyes fell upon Robert and Mary Grant, and he\nstopped short, finally replying:\n\n\"Never mind, my dear Glenarvan. I am a madman, a fool, an incorrigible\nbeing, and shall die a most famous blunderer!\"\n\nThe affair was no longer discussed. The mystery of the Duncan's\npresence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved,\nthought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a\ngood breakfast.\n\nHowever, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom\nAustin with them. They wished to question him further.\n\n\"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail\nfor the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I\nam not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could\nI act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your\ninstructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done\ndifferently, captain?\"", "\"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles.\n\n\"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was\nnecessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of\ncircumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that\nI was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover,\non leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did\nnot know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had\ndisappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me\nvery much.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\"\n\n\"And since that time?\"\n\n\"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\"\n\nLady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances of Ayrton's mysterious life,\nespecially as regarded Harry Grant and the Britannia. He therefore\nresumed his inquiries, speaking with extreme mildness, and imposing the\nmost perfect calmness upon the violent agitation of his heart.\n\n\"I hope, Ayrton,\" continued he, \"that you will not refuse to answer\ncertain questions that I desire to ask you. And, first, am I to call\nyou Ayrton or Ben Joyce? Are you the quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\nAyrton remained unmoved, watching the coast, deaf to every question.\nGlenarvan, whose eye flashed with some inward emotion, continued to\nquestion him.\n\n\"Will you tell me how you left the Britannia, and why you were in\nAustralia?\"\n\nThere was the same silence, the same obstinacy.\n\n\"Listen to me, Ayrton,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"It is for your interest to\nspeak. We may reward a frank confession, which is your only resort. For\nthe last time, will you answer my questions?\"\n\nAyrton turned his head towards Glenarvan, and looked him full in the\nface.\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"I have nothing to answer. It is for justice to\nprove against me.\"\n\n\"The proofs will be easy,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: USELESS APPEALS.]\n\n\"Easy, my lord?\" continued the quartermaster, in a sneering tone.\n\"Your lordship seems to me very hasty. I declare that the best judge\nin Westminster Hall would be puzzled to establish my identity. Who can\nsay why I came to Australia, since Captain Grant is no longer here to\ninform you? Who can prove that I am that Ben Joyce described by the\npolice, since they have never laid hands upon me, and my companions are\nat liberty? Who, except you, can charge me, not to say with a crime,\nbut even with a culpable action?\"\n\n[Illustration: Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck\nwith a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.]\n\nAyrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his\nformer indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would\nend the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said:\n\n\"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my\nbusiness. It is important that our respective positions should be\nclearly defined. I ask nothing that can implicate you, for that is the\npart of justice. But you know what search I am pursuing, and, with a\nword, you can put me on the track I have lost. Will you speak?\"\n\nAyrton shook his head, like a man determined to keep silent.\n\n\"Will you tell me where Captain Grant is?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Will you point out where the Britannia was wrecked?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, in almost a suppliant tone, \"will you, at\nleast, if you know where Captain Grant is, tell his poor children, who\nare only waiting for a word from your lips?\"\n\nThe quartermaster hesitated; his features quivered; but, in a low\nvoice, he muttered:\n\n\"I cannot, my lord.\"\n\nThen, as if he reproached himself for a moment's weakness, he added,\nangrily:\n\n\"No, I will not speak! Hang me if you will!\"\n\n\"Hang, then!\" cried Glenarvan, overcome by a sudden feeling of\nindignation.\n\nBut finally controlling himself, he said, in a grave voice:\n\n\"There are neither judges nor hangmen here. At the first landing-place\nyou shall be put into the hands of the English authorities.\"\n\n\"Just what I desire,\" replied the quartermaster.\n\nThereupon he was taken back to the cabin that served as his prison, and\ntwo sailors were stationed at the door, with orders to watch all his\nmovements. The witnesses of this scene retired indignant and in despair.\n\nSince Glenarvan had failed to overcome Ayrton's obstinacy, what was\nto be done? Evidently to follow the plan formed at Eden, of returning\nto England, and resuming hereafter this unsuccessful enterprise, for\nall traces of the Britannia now seemed irrevocably lost. The document\nadmitted of no new interpretation. There was no other country on the\nline of the thirty-seventh parallel, and the only way was to sail for\nhome.\n\nHe consulted his friends, and more especially Captain Mangles, on the\nsubject of return. The captain examined his store-rooms. The supply\nof coal would not last more than fifteen days. It was, therefore,\nnecessary to replenish the fuel at the first port. He accordingly\nproposed to Glenarvan to sail for Talcahuana Bay, where the Duncan had\nalready procured supplies before undertaking her voyage. This was a\ndirect passage. Then the yacht, with ample provisions, could double\nCape Horn, and reach Scotland by way of the Atlantic.\n\nThis plan being adopted, the engineer was ordered to force on steam.\nHalf an hour afterwards the yacht was headed towards Talcahuana, and at\nsix o'clock in the evening the mountains of New Zealand had disappeared\nbeneath the mists of the horizon.\n\n[Sidenote: WOMANLY INFLUENCE.]", "[Sidenote: WOMANLY INFLUENCE.]\n\nIt was a sad return for these brave searchers, who had left the shores\nof Scotland with such hope and confidence. To the joyous cries that\nhad saluted Glenarvan on his return succeeded profound dejection. Each\nconfined himself to the solitude of his cabin, and rarely appeared on\ndeck. All, even the loquacious Paganel, were mournful and silent. If\nGlenarvan spoke of beginning his search again, the geographer shook\nhis head like a man who has no more hope, for he seemed convinced as\nto the fate of the shipwrecked sailors. Yet there was one man on board\nwho could have informed them about this catastrophe, but whose silence\nwas still prolonged. There was no doubt that the rascally Ayrton knew,\nif not the actual situation of the captain, at least the place of the\nshipwreck. Probably Harry Grant, if found, would be a witness against\nhim; hence he persisted in his silence, and was greatly enraged,\nespecially towards the sailors who would accuse him of an evil design.\n\nSeveral times Glenarvan renewed his attempts with the quartermaster.\nPromises and threats were useless. Ayrton's obstinacy was carried\nso far, and was so inexplicable, that the major came to the belief\nthat he knew nothing; which opinion was shared by the geographer and\ncorroborated his own ideas in regard to Captain Grant.\n\nBut if Ayrton knew nothing, why did he not plead his ignorance? It\ncould not turn against him, while his silence increased the difficulty\nof forming a new plan. Ought they to infer the presence of Harry Grant\nin Australia from meeting the quartermaster on that continent? At all\nevents, they must induce Ayrton to explain on this subject.\n\nLady Helena, seeing her husband's failures, now suggested an attempt,\nin her turn, to persuade the quartermaster. Where a man had failed,\nperhaps a woman could succeed by her gentle entreaty. Glenarvan,\nknowing the tact of his young wife, gave his hearty approval. Ayrton\nwas, accordingly, brought to Lady Helena's boudoir. Mary Grant was to\nbe present at the interview, for the young girl's influence might also\nbe great, and Lady Helena would not neglect any chance of success.\n\n[Illustration: For an hour the two ladies were closeted with the\nquartermaster, but nothing resulted from this conference.]\n\nFor an hour the two ladies were closeted with the quartermaster, but\nnothing resulted from this conference. What they said, the arguments\nthey used to draw out the convict's secret, all the details of this\nexamination, remained unknown. Moreover, when Ayrton left them they did\nnot appear to have succeeded, and their faces betokened real despair.\n\n[Illustration: He contented himself with shrugging his shoulders,\nwhich so increased the rage of the crew, that nothing less than the\nintervention of the captain and his lordship could restrain them.]\n\n\nWhen the quartermaster was taken back to his cabin, therefore, the\nsailors saluted his appearance with violent threats. But he contented\nhimself with shrugging his shoulders, which so increased the rage of\nthe crew, that nothing less than the intervention of the captain and\nhis lordship could restrain them.\n\nBut Lady Helena did not consider herself defeated. She wished to\nstruggle to the last with this heartless man, and the next day she went\nherself to Ayrton's cabin, to avoid the scene that his appearance on\ndeck occasioned.\n\nFor two long hours this kind and gentle Scotch lady remained alone face\nto face with the chief of the convicts. Glenarvan, a prey to nervous\nagitation, lingered near the cabin, now determined to thoroughly\nexhaust the chances of success, and now upon the point of drawing his\nwife away from this painful and prolonged interview.\n\nBut this time, when Lady Helena reappeared, her features inspired\nconfidence. Had she, then, brought this secret to light, and stirred\nthe dormant feeling of pity in the heart of this poor creature?\n\nMacNabb, who saw her first, could not repress a very natural feeling\nof incredulity. However, the rumor soon spread among the crew that the\nquartermaster had at length yielded to Lady Helena's entreaties. All\nthe sailors assembled on deck more quickly than if Tom Austin's whistle\nhad summoned them.\n\n\"Has he spoken?\" asked Lord Glenarvan of his wife.\n\n\"No,\" replied Lady Helena; \"but in compliance with my entreaties he\ndesires to see you.\"\n\n\"Ah, dear Helena, you have succeeded!\"\n\n\"I hope so, Edward.\"\n\n\"Have you made any promise that I am to sanction?\"\n\n\"Only one: that you will use all your influence to moderate the fate in\nstore for him.\" [Sidenote: VERY BUSINESS-LIKE.]\n\n\"Certainly, my dear Helena. Let him come to me immediately.\"\n\nLady Helena retired to her cabin, accompanied by Mary Grant, and the\nquartermaster was taken to the saloon where Glenarvan awaited him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nA DISCOURAGING CONFESSION.\n\n\nAs soon as the quartermaster was in Lord Glenarvan's presence his\ncustodians retired.\n\n\"You desired to speak to me, Ayrton?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied he.\n\n\"To me alone?\"\n\n\"Yes; but I think that if Major MacNabb and Mr. Paganel were present at\nthe interview it would be better.\"\n\n\"For whom?\"\n\n\"For me.\"\n\nAyrton spoke calmly. Glenarvan gazed at him steadily, and then sent\nword to MacNabb and Paganel, who at once obeyed his summons.\n\n\"We are ready for you,\" said Glenarvan, as soon as his two friends were\nseated at the cabin-table.\n\nAyrton reflected for a few moments, and then said:\n\n\"My lord, it is customary for witnesses to be present at every contract\nor negotiation between two parties. That is why I requested the\npresence of Mr. Paganel and Major MacNabb; for, properly speaking, this\nis a matter of business that I am going to propose to you.\"\n\nGlenarvan, who was accustomed to Ayrton's manners, betrayed no\nsurprise, although a matter of business between this man and himself\nseemed strange.\n\n[Illustration: \"Do you agree or not?\"]\n\n[Sidenote: BARGAINING FOR TERMS.]\n\n\"What is this business?\" said he.\n\n\"This is it,\" replied Ayrton. \"You desire to know from me certain\ncircumstances which may be useful to you. I desire to obtain from you\ncertain advantages which will be valuable to me. Now, I will make an\nexchange, my lord. Do you agree or not?\"\n\n\"What are these circumstances?\" asked Paganel, quickly.\n\n\"No,\" corrected Glenarvan: \"what are these advantages?\"\n\nAyrton bowed, showing that he understood the distinction.\n\n\"These,\" said he, \"are the advantages for which I petition. You\nstill intend, my lord, to deliver me into the hands of the English\nauthorities?\"\n\n\"Yes, Ayrton; it is only justice.\"\n\n\"I do not deny it,\" replied the quartermaster. \"You would not consent,\nthen, to set me at liberty?\"\n\nGlenarvan hesitated before answering a question so plainly asked.\nPerhaps the fate of Harry Grant depended upon what he was about to say.\nHowever, the feeling of duty towards humanity prevailed, and he said:\n\n\"No, Ayrton, I cannot set you at liberty.\"\n\n\"I do not ask it,\" replied the quartermaster, proudly.\n\n\"What do you wish, then?\"\n\n\"An intermediate fate, my lord, between that which you think awaits me\nand the liberty that you cannot grant me.\"\n\n\"And that is----?\"\n\n\"To abandon me on one of the desert islands of the Pacific, with the\nprincipal necessaries of life. I will manage as I can, and repent, if I\nhave time.\"\n\nGlenarvan, who was little prepared for this proposal, glanced at his\ntwo friends, who remained silent. After a few moments of reflection, he\nreplied:\n\n\"Ayrton, if I grant your request, will you tell me all that it is for\nmy interest to know?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; that is to say, all that I know concerning Captain Grant\nand the Britannia.\"\n\n\"The whole truth?\"\n\n\"The whole.\"\n\n\"But who will warrant----?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see what troubles you, my lord. You do not like to trust to\nme,--to the word of a malefactor! That is right. But what can you do?\nThe situation is thus. You have only to accept or refuse.\"\n\n\"I will trust you, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, simply.\n\n\"And you will be right, my lord. Moreover, if I deceive you, you will\nalways have the power to revenge yourself.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By recapturing me on this island, from which I shall not be able to\nescape.\"\n\nAyrton had a reply for everything. He met all difficulties, and\nproduced unanswerable arguments against himself. As was seen, he\nstrove to treat in his business with good faith. It was impossible for\na person to surrender with more perfect confidence, and yet he found\nmeans to advance still further in this disinterested course.\n\n\"My lord and gentlemen,\" added he, \"I desire that you should be\nconvinced that I am honorable. I do not seek to deceive you, but am\ngoing to give you a new proof of my sincerity in this affair. I act\nfrankly, because I rely upon your loyalty.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"My lord, I have not yet your promise to agree to my proposition, and\nstill I do not hesitate to tell you that I know little concerning Harry\nGrant.\"\n\n\"Little!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord; the circumstances that I am able to communicate to\nyou are relative to myself. They are personal experiences, and will\nscarcely tend to put you on the track you have lost.\"\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS AND DISCLOSURES.]\n\nA keen disappointment was manifest on the features of Glenarvan and\nthe major. They had believed the quartermaster to possess an important\nsecret, and yet he now confessed that his disclosures would be almost\nuseless.\n\nHowever that may be, this avowal of Ayrton, who surrendered himself\nwithout security, singularly affected his hearers, especially when he\nadded, in conclusion:\n\n\"Thus you are forewarned, my lord, that the business will be less\nadvantageous for you than for me.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Glenarvan; \"I accept your proposal, Ayrton. You\nhave my word that you shall be landed at one of the islands of the\nPacific.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" said he.\n\nWas this strange man pleased with this decision? You might have doubted\nit, for his impassive countenance betrayed no emotion. He seemed as if\nacting for another more than for himself.", "Was this strange man pleased with this decision? You might have doubted\nit, for his impassive countenance betrayed no emotion. He seemed as if\nacting for another more than for himself.\n\n\"I am ready to answer,\" continued he.\n\n\"We have no questions to ask you,\" rejoined Glenarvan. \"Tell us what\nyou know, Ayrton, and, in the first place, who you are.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied he, \"I am really Tom Ayrton, quartermaster of the\nBritannia. I left Glasgow in Captain Grant's ship on the 12th of March,\n1861. For fourteen months we traversed together the Pacific, seeking\nsome favorable place to found a Scottish colony. Harry Grant was a man\ncapable of performing great deeds, but frequently serious disputes\narose between us. His character did not harmonize with mine. I could\nnot yield; but with Harry Grant, when his resolution is taken, all\nresistance is impossible. He is like iron towards himself and others.\nHowever, I dared to mutiny, and attempted to involve the crew and gain\npossession of the vessel. Whether I did right or wrong is of little\nimportance. However it may be, Captain Grant did not hesitate to land\nme, April 8, 1862, on the west coast of Australia.\"\n\n\"Australia!\" exclaimed the major, interrupting Ayrton's story. \"Then\nyou left the Britannia before her arrival at Callao, where the last\nnews of her was dated?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the quartermaster; \"for the Britannia never stopped at\nCallao while I was on board. If I spoke of Callao at O'Moore's farm, it\nwas your story that gave me this information.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: MORE BLANKS THAN PRIZES.]\n\n\"I found myself, therefore, abandoned on an almost desert coast, but\nonly twenty miles from the penitentiary of Perth, the capital of\nWestern Australia. Wandering along the shore, I met a band of convicts\nwho had just escaped. I joined them. You will spare me, my lord, the\naccount of my life for two years and a half. It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived.\nDuring your visit at the farm you related, my lord, the whole story of\nCaptain Grant. I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's\nstoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate\nthe Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of\nthe British navy. However, there were serious injuries to be repaired.\nI therefore let her start for Melbourne, and offered myself to you in\nmy real character of quartermaster, volunteering to guide you to the\nscene of the shipwreck, which I falsely located on the eastern coast\nof Australia. Thus followed at a distance and sometimes preceded by\nmy band of convicts, I conducted your party across the province of\nVictoria. My companions committed a useless crime at Camden Bridge,\nsince the Duncan, once at Twofold Bay, could not have escaped me, and\nwith it I should have been master of the ocean. I brought you thus\nunsuspectingly as far as the Snowy River. The horses and oxen fell dead\none by one, poisoned by the gastrolobium. I entangled the cart in the\nmarshes. At my suggestion----but you know the rest, my lord, and can\nbe certain that, except for Mr. Paganel's absent-mindedness, I should\nnow be commander on board the Duncan. Such is my story, gentlemen. My\ndisclosures, unfortunately, cannot set you on the track of Captain\nGrant, and you see that in dealing with me you have made a bad bargain.\"\n\nThe quartermaster ceased, crossed his arms, according to his custom,\nand waited. Glenarvan and his friends were silent. They felt that this\nstrange criminal had told the entire truth. The capture of the Duncan\nhad only failed through a cause altogether beyond his control. His\naccomplices had reached Twofold Bay, as the convict's blouse, found by\nGlenarvan, proved. There, faithful to the orders of their chief, they\nhad lain in wait for the yacht, and at last, tired of watching, they\nhad doubtless resumed their occupation of plunder and burning in the\nfields of New South Wales.\n\nThe major was the first to resume the examination, in order to\ndetermine the dates relative to the Britannia.\n\n\"It was the 8th of April, 1862, then, that you were landed on the west\ncoast of Australia?\" he asked of the quartermaster.\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"And do you know what Captain Grant's plans were then?\"\n\n\"Vaguely.\"\n\n\"Continue, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan. \"The least sign may set us on the\ntrack.\"\n\n\"What I can say is this, my lord. Captain Grant intended to visit New\nZealand. But this part of his programme was not carried out while I was\non board. The Britannia might, therefore, after leaving Callao, have\ngained the shores of New Zealand. This would agree with the date, June\n27, 1862, given in the document as the time of the shipwreck.\"\n\n\"Evidently,\" remarked Paganel.\n\n\"But,\" added Glenarvan, \"there is nothing in these half-obliterated\nportions of the document which can apply to New Zealand.\"\n\n\"That I cannot answer,\" said the quartermaster.\n\n\"Well, Ayrton,\" continued Glenarvan, \"you have kept your word, and I\nwill keep mine. We will decide on what island of the Pacific you shall\nbe abandoned.\"\n\n\"Oh, it matters little to me,\" answered Ayrton.\n\n\"Return to your cabin now, and await our decision.\"\n\nThe quartermaster retired, under guard of the two sailors.\n\n\"This villain might have been a great man,\" observed the major.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan. \"He has a strong and self-reliant character.\nWhy must his abilities be devoted to crime?\"\n\n\"But Harry Grant?\"\n\n\"I fear that he is forever lost! Poor children! who could tell them\nwhere their father is?\"\n\n\"I!\" cried Paganel.\n\nAs we have remarked, the geographer, although so loquacious and\nexcitable usually, had scarcely spoken during Ayrton's examination. He\nhad listened in total silence. But this last word that he had uttered\nwas worth more than all the others, and startled Glenarvan at once.\n\n\"You, Paganel!\" he exclaimed; \"do you know where Captain Grant is?\"\n\n\"As well as can be known,\" answered the geographer.\n\n\"And how do you know?\"\n\n\"By that everlasting document.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A GEOGRAPHER'S REMINISCENCES.]\n\n\"Ah!\" said the major, in a tone of the most thorough incredulity.\n\n\"Listen first, MacNabb, and shrug your shoulders afterwards. I did\nnot speak before, because you would not have believed me. Besides, it\nwas useless. But if I speak to-day, it is because Ayrton's opinion\ncorroborates mine.\"\n\n\"Then New Zealand----?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Hear and judge,\" replied Paganel. \"I did not commit the blunder\nthat saved us, without reason. Just as I was writing that letter\nat Glenarvan's dictation, the word Zealand was troubling my brain.\nYou remember that we were in the cart. MacNabb had just told Lady\nHelena the story of the convicts, and had handed her the copy of the\n_Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ that gave an account of the\naccident at Camden Bridge. As I was writing, the paper lay on the\nground, folded so that only two syllables of its title could be seen,\nand these were _aland_. What a light broke in upon my mind! 'Aland'\nwas one of the very words in the English document,--a word that we had\nhitherto translated _ashore_, but which was the termination of the\nproper name Zealand.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Paganel, with profound conviction, \"this\ninterpretation had escaped me, and do you know why? Because my\nexaminations were naturally confined more particularly to the French\ndocument, where this important word was wanting.\"\n\n\"Ho! ho!\" laughed the major, \"that is too much imagination, Paganel.\nYou forget your previous conclusions rather easily.\"\n\n\"Well, major, I am ready to answer you.\"\n\n\"Then what becomes of your word _austral_?\"\n\n\"It is what it was at first. It simply means the southern (_australes_)\ncountries.\"\n\n\"Very well. But that word _indi_, that was first the root of Indians\n(_indiens_), and then of natives (_indig\u00e8nes_)?\"\n\n\"The third and last time, it shall be the first two syllables of the\nword _indigence_ (destitution).\"\n\n\"And _contin_!\" cried MacNabb; \"does it still signify _continent_?\"\n\n\"No, since New Zealand is only an island.\"\n\n\"Then?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"My dear lord,\" replied Paganel, \"I will translate the document for\nyou, according to my third interpretation, and you shall judge. I only\nmake two suggestions. First, forget as far as possible the previous\ninterpretations; and next, although certain passages will seem to you\nforced, and I may translate them wrongly, still, remember that they\nhave no special importance. Moreover, the French document serves as the\nbasis of my interpretation, and you must consider that it was written\nby an Englishman who could not have been perfectly familiar with the\nidioms of our language.\"\n\nSo saying, Paganel, slowly pronouncing each syllable, read the\nfollowing:\n\n\"On the 27th of June, 1862, the brig Britannia, of Glasgow, foundered,\nafter a long struggle (_agonie_), in the South (_australes_) Seas, on\nthe coasts of New Ze_aland_. Two sailors and Captain Grant succeeded\nin landing (_abor_der). Here, continually (_contin_uellement) a prey\n(_pr_oie) to a cruel (_cruel_le) destitution (_indi_gence), they cast\nthis document into the sea, at longitude ---- and latitude 37\u00b0 11'.\nCome to their assistance, or they are lost.\"", "Paganel stopped. His interpretation was admissible. But, although\nit appeared as probable as the other, still it might be as false.\nGlenarvan and the major therefore no longer attempted to dispute it.\nHowever, since the traces of the Britannia had not been encountered on\nthe coasts of Patagonia or Australia, the chances were in favor of New\nZealand.\n\n\"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"will you tell me why, for about two\nmonths, you kept this interpretation secret?\"\n\n[Sidenote: UNANIMITY IN DESPAIR.]\n\n\"Because I did not wish to give you vain hopes. Besides, we were going\nto Auckland, which is on the very latitude of the document.\"\n\n\"But afterwards, when we were taken out of our course, why did you not\nspeak?\"\n\n\"Because, however just this interpretation may be, it cannot contribute\nto the captain's rescue.\"\n\n\"Why, Paganel?\"\n\n\"Because, admitting that Captain Grant was wrecked on the coast of New\nZealand, as long as he has not made his appearance for two years since\nthe disaster, he must have fallen a victim to the sea or the savages.\"\n\n\"Then your opinion is----?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"That we might perhaps find some traces of the shipwreck, but that the\nseamen of the Britannia have perished.\"\n\n\"Keep all this silent, my friends,\" replied Glenarvan, \"and leave me to\nchoose the time for telling this sad news to the children of Captain\nGrant.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nA CRY IN THE NIGHT.\n\n\nThe crew soon learned that Ayrton's disclosures had not thrown light\nupon the situation of Captain Grant. The despair on board was profound,\nfor they had relied on the quartermaster, who, however, knew nothing\nthat could put the Duncan on the track of the Britannia. The yacht\ntherefore continued on the same course, and the only question now was\nto choose the island on which to leave Ayrton.\n\nPaganel and Captain Mangles consulted the maps on board. Exactly on\nthe thirty-seventh parallel was an island, generally known by the\nname of Maria Theresa, a lone rock in the midst of the Pacific, three\nthousand five hundred miles from the American coast, and one thousand\nfive hundred miles from New Zealand. No ship ever came within hail of\nthis solitary isle; no tidings from the world ever reached it. Only the\nstorm-birds rested here during their long flights, and many maps do not\neven indicate its position.\n\nIf anywhere absolute isolation was to be found on earth, it was here,\nafar from the ocean's traveled highways. Its situation was made known\nto Ayrton, who consented to live there; and the vessel was accordingly\nheaded towards the island. Two days later the lookout hailed land on\nthe horizon. It was Maria Theresa, low, long, and scarcely emerging\nfrom the waves, appearing like some enormous sea-monster. Thirty miles\nstill lay between it and the yacht, whose prow cut the waves with\nsuch speed that soon the island grew distinct. The sun, now sinking\ntowards the west, defined its outlines in glowing light. Several slight\nelevations were tinged with the last rays of the day.\n\nAt five o'clock Captain Mangles thought he distinguished a faint smoke\nrising towards the sky.\n\n\"Is that a volcano?\" he inquired of Paganel, who, with his telescope,\nwas examining the land.\n\n\"I do not know what to think,\" replied the geographer. \"Maria Theresa\nis a point little known. However, I should not be surprised if its\norigin was due to some volcanic upheaval.\"\n\n\"But then,\" said Glenarvan, \"if an eruption created it, may we not fear\nthat the same agency will destroy it?\"\n\n\"That is scarcely probable,\" answered Paganel. \"Its existence has\nbeen known for several centuries; and this seems a guarantee for its\ncontinuance.\"\n\n\"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"do you think, captain, that we can land\nbefore night?\"\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER ARTIFICIAL VOLCANO.]\n\n\"No, certainly not. I ought not to endanger the Duncan in the darkness,\non a coast that is not familiar to me. I will keep a short distance\nfrom land, and to-morrow at daybreak we will send a boat ashore.\"\n\nAt eight o'clock Maria Theresa, although only five miles to windward,\nappeared like a lengthened shadow, scarcely visible. An hour later,\nquite a bright light, like a fire, blazed in the darkness. It was\nmotionless and stationary.\n\n\"That would seem to indicate a volcano,\" said Paganel, watching it\nattentively.\n\n\"However,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"at this distance we ought to hear\nthe commotion that always accompanies an eruption, and yet the wind\nbrings no sound to our ears.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" observed Paganel, \"this volcano glows, but does not\nspeak. You might say that it throws out intermittent flashes like a\nlighthouse.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" continued Captain Mangles; \"and yet we are not on the\nilluminated side. Ha!\" cried he, \"another fire! On the shore this time!\nSee! it moves, it changes its place!\"\n\nHe was not mistaken. A new light had appeared, that sometimes seemed to\ngo out, and then all at once flash forth again.\n\n\"Is the island inhabited?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Evidently, by savages,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Then we cannot abandon the quartermaster here.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the major; \"that would be giving even savages too dangerous\na present.\"\n\n\"We will seek some other deserted island,\" resumed Glenarvan, who could\nnot help smiling at MacNabb's delicacy. \"I promised Ayrton his life,\nand I will keep my promise.\"\n\n\"At all events, let us beware,\" added Paganel. \"The New Zealanders have\nthe barbarous custom of misleading ships by moving fires. The natives\nof Maria Theresa may understand this deception.\"\n\n\"Bear away a point,\" cried the captain to the sailor at the helm.\n\"To-morrow, at sunrise, we shall know what is to be done.\"\n\nAt eleven o'clock the passengers and the captain retired to their\ncabins. At the bow the first watch was pacing the deck, while at the\nstern the helmsman was alone at his post.\n\nIn the stillness Mary and Robert Grant came on deck. The two children,\nleaning upon the railing, gazed sadly at the phosphorescent sea and the\nluminous wake of the yacht. Mary thought of Robert's future; Robert\nthought of his sister's; both thought of their father. Was that beloved\nparent still living? Yet must they give him up? But no, what would life\nbe without him? What would become of them without his protection? What\nwould have become of them already, except for the magnanimity of Lord\nand Lady Glenarvan?\n\nThe boy, taught by misfortune, divined the thoughts that were agitating\nhis sister. He took her hand in his.\n\n\"Mary,\" said he, \"we must never despair. Remember the lessons our\nfather taught us. 'Courage compensates for everything in this world,'\nhe said. Let us have that indomitable courage that overcomes all\nobstacles. Hitherto you have labored for me, my sister, but now I shall\nlabor for you.\"\n\n\"Dear Robert!\" replied the young girl.\n\n\"I must tell you one thing,\" continued he. \"You will not be sorry,\nMary?\"\n\n\"Why should I be sorry, my child?\"\n\n\"And you will let me do as I wish?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked she, anxiously.\n\n\"My sister, I shall be a sailor----!\"\n\n\"And leave me?\" cried the young girl, clasping her brother's hand.\n\n[Sidenote: EULOGY AND THRENODY.]\n\n\"Yes, sister, I shall be a sailor, like my father, and like Captain\nJohn. Mary, my dear Mary, he has not lost all hope! You will have, like\nme, confidence in his devotion. He has promised that he will make me a\nthorough and efficient sailor, and we shall seek our father together.\nSay that you are willing, sister. What our father would have done for\nus it is our duty, or mine at least, to do for him. My life has but one\nobject, to which it is wholly devoted,--to search always for him who\nwould never have abandoned either of us. Dear Mary, how good our father\nwas!\"\n\n\"And so noble, so generous!\" added Mary. \"Do you know, Robert, that he\nwas already one of the glories of our country, and would have ranked\namong its great men if fate had not arrested his course?\"\n\n\"How well I know it!\" answered Robert.\n\nMary pressed her brother to her heart, and the child felt tears\ndropping upon his forehead.\n\n\"Mary! Mary!\" cried he, \"it is in vain for them to speak, or to keep\nsilent. I hope still, and shall always do so. A man like our father\ndoes not die till he has accomplished his purpose!\"\n\nMary Grant could not reply; sobs choked her utterance. A thousand\nemotions agitated her soul at the thought that new attempts would be\nmade to find her father, and that the young captain's devotion was\nboundless.\n\n\"Does Mr. John still hope?\" asked she.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert. \"He is a brother who will never forsake us. I\nshall be a sailor, shall I not, sister,--a sailor to seek my father\nwith him? Are you willing?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mary. \"But must we be separated?\"\n\n\"You will not be alone, Mary, I know. John has told me so. Lady Helena\nwill not permit you to leave her. You are a woman, and can and ought to\naccept her benefits. To refuse them would be ungrateful. But a man, as\nmy father has told me a hundred times, ought to make his own fortune.\"\n\n\"But what will become of our house at Dundee, so full of associations?\"\n\n\"We will keep it, my sister. All that has been well arranged by our\nfriend John and Lord Glenarvan, who will keep you at Malcolm Castle\nlike a daughter. He said so to John, who told me. You will be at home\nthere, and wait till John and I bring back our father. Ah, what a\njoyful day that will be!\" cried Robert, whose face was radiant with\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"My brother, my child!\" exclaimed Mary, \"how happy our father would be\nif he could hear you! How much you resemble him, dear Robert! When you\nare a man you will be quite like him!\"\n\n\"God grant it, Mary!\" said Robert, glowing with holy and filial pride.\n\n\"But how shall we pay our debt to Lord and Lady Glenarvan?\" continued\nMary.\n\n\"Oh, that will not be difficult,\" answered Robert, with his boyish\nimpulsiveness. \"We will tell them how much we love and respect them,\nand we will show it to them by our actions.\"\n\n\"That is all we can do!\" added the young girl, covering her brother's\nface with kisses; \"and all that they will like, too!\"", "\"That is all we can do!\" added the young girl, covering her brother's\nface with kisses; \"and all that they will like, too!\"\n\nThen, relapsing into reveries, the two children of the captain gazed\nsilently into the shadowy obscurity of the night. However, in fancy\nthey still conversed, questioned, and answered each other. The sea\nrocked the ship in silence, and the phosphorescent waters glistened in\nthe darkness.\n\nBut now a strange, a seemingly supernatural event took place. The\nbrother and sister, by one of those magnetic attractions that\nmysteriously draw the souls of friends together, experienced at the\nsame instant the same curious hallucination.\n\n[Sidenote: \"METHOUGHT, THE BILLOWS SPOKE!\"]\n\nFrom the midst of these alternately brightening and darkening waves,\nthey thought they heard a voice issue, whose depth of sadness stirred\nevery fibre of their hearts.\n\n\"Help! help!\" cried the voice.\n\n\"Mary,\" said Robert, \"did you hear?\"\n\nAnd, raising their heads above the bulwarks, they both gazed\nsearchingly into the misty shadows of the night. Yet there was nothing\nbut the darkness stretching blankly before them.\n\n\"Robert,\" said Mary, pale with emotion, \"I thought--yes, I thought like\nyou.\"\n\nAt this moment another cry reached them, and this time the illusion was\nsuch that these words broke simultaneously from both their hearts:\n\n\"My father! my father!\"\n\nThis was too much for Mary Grant. Overcome by emotion, she sank\nsenseless into her brother's arms.\n\n\"Help!\" cried Robert. \"My sister! my father! help!\"\n\nThe man at the helm hastened to Miss Grant's assistance, and after\nhim the sailors of the watch, Captain Mangles, Lady Helena, and Lord\nGlenarvan, who had been suddenly awakened.\n\n\"My sister is dying, and my father is yonder!\" exclaimed Robert,\npointing to the waves.\n\nNo one understood his words.\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated he, \"my father is yonder! I heard his voice, and Mary\ndid too!\"\n\nJust then Mary Grant recovered consciousness, and, looking wildly\naround, cried:\n\n\"My father, my father is yonder!\"\n\nThe unfortunate girl arose, and, leaning over the bulwark, would have\nthrown herself into the sea.\n\n\"My lord! Madam!\" repeated she, clasping her hands, \"I tell you my\nfather is there! I declare to you that I heard his voice issue from the\nwaves like a despairing wail, like a last adieu!\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE POSITIVENESS OF DISBELIEF.]\n\nThen her feelings overcame the poor girl, and she became insensible.\nThey carried her to her cabin, and Lady Helena followed, to minister to\nher wants, while Robert kept repeating:\n\n[Illustration: The unfortunate girl arose, and, leaning over the\nbulwark, would have thrown herself into the sea.]\n\n\"My father! my father is there! I am sure of it, my lord!\"\n\nThe witnesses of this sorrowful scene perceived at last that the two\nchildren had been the sport of an hallucination. But how undeceive\ntheir senses, which had been so strongly impressed? Glenarvan, however,\nattempted it, and taking Robert by the hand, said:\n\n\"You heard your father's voice, my dear boy?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord. Yonder, in the midst of the waves, he cried, 'Help!\nhelp!'\"\n\n\"And you recognized the voice?\"\n\n\"Did I recognize it? Oh, yes, I assure you! My sister heard and\nrecognized it, too. How could both of us be deceived? My lord, let us\ngo to his rescue. A boat! a boat!\"\n\nGlenarvan saw plainly that he could not undeceive the poor child.\nStill, he made a last attempt, and called the helmsman.\n\n\"Hawkins,\" asked he, \"you were at the wheel when Miss Grant was so\nsingularly affected?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Hawkins.\n\n\"And you did not see or hear anything?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"You see how it is, Robert.\"\n\n\"If it had been _his_ father,\" answered the lad, with irrepressible\nenergy, \"he would not say so. It was _my_ father, my lord! my father,\nmy father----!\"\n\nRobert's voice was choked by a sob. Pale and speechless, he, too, like\nhis sister, lost consciousness. Glenarvan had him carried to his bed,\nand the child, overcome by emotion, sank into a profound slumber.\n\n\"Poor orphans!\" said Captain Mangles; \"God tries them in a terrible\nway!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"excessive grief has produced upon both at\nthe same moment a similar effect.\"\n\n\"Upon both!\" murmured Paganel. \"That is strange!\"\n\nThen, leaning forward, after making a sign to keep still, he listened\nattentively. The silence was profound everywhere. Paganel called in a\nloud voice, but there was no answer.\n\n\"It is strange!\" repeated the geographer, returning to his cabin; \"an\nintimate sympathy of thought and grief does not suffice to explain this\nmystery.\"\n\nEarly the next morning the passengers (and among them were Robert\nand Mary, for it was impossible to restrain them) were assembled\non deck. All wished to examine this land, which had been scarcely\ndistinguishable the night before. The principal points of the island\nwere eagerly scanned. The yacht coasted along about a mile from the\nshore, and the unassisted eye could easily discern the larger objects.\n\nSuddenly Robert uttered a cry. He maintained that he saw two men\nrunning and gesticulating, while a third was waving a flag.\n\n\"Yes: the flag of England!\" cried Captain Mangles, when he had used his\nglass.\n\n\"It is true!\" said Paganel, turning quickly towards Robert.\n\n\"My lord!\" exclaimed the boy, trembling with excitement,--\"my lord, if\nyou do not wish me to swim to the island, you will lower a boat! Ah, my\nlord, if you please, I do wish to be the first to land!\"\n\n[Sidenote: A COMPENSATION FOR ALL.]\n\nNo one knew what to say. Were there three men, shipwrecked sailors,\nEnglishmen, on that island? All recalled the events of the night\nbefore, and thought of the voice heard by Robert and Mary. Perhaps,\nafter all, they were not mistaken. A voice might have reached them.\nBut could this voice be that of their father? No, alas, no! And each,\nthinking of the terrible disappointment that was probably in store,\ntrembled lest this new trial would exceed their strength. But how\nrestrain them? Lord Glenarvan had not the courage.\n\n\"Lower the boat!\" cried he.\n\nIn a moment this was done; the two children, Glenarvan, Captain\nMangles, and Paganel stepped into it, and six earnest and skilled\noarsmen sped away towards the shore.\n\nAt ten yards therefrom, Mary uttered again the heart-rending cry:\n\n\"My father!\"\n\nA man was standing on the beach between two others. His form was tall\nand stout, while his weather-beaten yet pleasant countenance betrayed\na strong resemblance to the features of Mary and Robert Grant. It was,\nindeed, the man whom the children had so often described. Their hearts\nhad not deceived them. It was their father, it was Captain Grant!\n\nHe heard his daughter's cry, he opened his arms, and supported her\nfainting form.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nCAPTAIN GRANT'S STORY.\n\n\nJoy does not kill, for the long lost father and his recovered children\nwere soon rejoicing together and preparing to return to the yacht. But\nhow can we depict that scene, so little looked for by any? Words are\npowerless.\n\n[Sidenote: THE JOYS OF REUNION.]\n\nAs soon as he gained the deck, Harry Grant sank upon his knees. The\npious Scotchman, on touching what was to him the soil of his country,\nwished, first of all, to thank God for his deliverance. Then, turning\ntowards Lady Helena; Lord Glenarvan, and their companions, he thanked\nthem in a voice broken by emotion. While on their way to the yacht, his\nchildren had briefly told him the story of the Duncan.\n\n[Illustration: A man was standing on the beach between two others. His\nform was tall and stout.]\n\nHow great a debt of gratitude did he feel that he owed this noble woman\nand her companions! From Lord Glenarvan down to the lowest sailor,\nhad not all struggled and suffered for him? Harry Grant expressed\nthe feelings of thankfulness that overflowed his heart with so much\nsimplicity and nobleness, and his manly countenance was illumined by so\npure and sincere a sentiment, that all felt themselves repaid for the\ntrials they had undergone. Even the imperturbable major's eye was wet\nwith a tear that he could not repress. As for Paganel, he wept like a\nchild who does not think of hiding his emotion.\n\nCaptain Grant could not cease gazing at his daughter. He found her\nbeautiful and charming, and told her so again and again, appealing\nto Lady Helena as if to be assured that his fatherly love was not\nmistaken. Then, turning to his son, he cried rapturously:\n\n\"How he has grown! He is a man!\"\n\nHe lavished upon these two beings, so dearly loved, the thousand\nexpressions of love that had been unuttered during long years of\nabsence. Robert introduced him successively to all his friends. All had\nalike proved their kindness and good wishes towards the two orphans.\nWhen Captain Mangles came to be introduced, he blushed like a young\ngirl, and his voice trembled as he saluted Mary's father.\n\nLady Helena then told the story of the voyage, and made the captain\nproud of his son and daughter. He learned the exploits of the young\nhero, and how the boy had already repaid part of his obligation to Lord\nGlenarvan at the peril of his life. Captain Mangles' language to Mary\nand concerning her was so truly loving, that Harry Grant, who had been\nalready informed on this point by Lady Helena, placed the hand of his\ndaughter in that of the noble young captain, and, turning towards Lord\nand Lady Glenarvan, said:\n\n\"My lord and lady, join with me to bless our children!\"\n\nIt was not long before Glenarvan related Ayrton's story to the captain,\nwho confirmed the quartermaster's declaration in regard to his having\nbeen abandoned on the Australian coast.\n\n\"He is a shrewd and courageous man,\" added he; \"but his passions have\nruined him. May meditation and repentance lead him to better feelings!\"", "\"He is a shrewd and courageous man,\" added he; \"but his passions have\nruined him. May meditation and repentance lead him to better feelings!\"\n\nBut before Ayrton was transferred to Tabor Island, Harry Grant wished\nto show his new friends the bounds of his habitation. He invited them\nto visit his house, and sit for once at his table. Glenarvan and his\ncompanions cordially accepted the invitation, and Robert and Mary\nwere not a little desirous to see those haunts where their father had\ndoubtless at times bewailed his fate. A boat was manned, and the whole\nparty soon disembarked on the shores of the island.\n\nA few hours sufficed to traverse Captain Grant's domain. It was in\nreality the summit of a submarine mountain, covered with basaltic rocks\nand volcanic fragments. When the shipwrecked seamen of the Britannia\ntook refuge here, the hand of man began to control the development of\nnature's resources, and in two years and a half the captain and his\ncompanions had completely metamorphosed their island home.\n\nThe visitors at last reached the house, shaded by verdant gum-trees,\nwhile before its windows stretched the glorious sea, glittering in\nthe rays of the sun. Harry Grant set his table in the shade, and all\ntook seats around it. Some cold roast meat, some of the produce of the\nbreadfruit-tree, several bowls of milk, two or three bunches of wild\nchicory, and pure, fresh water, formed the elements of the simple but\nhealthful repast. Paganel was in ecstasies. It recalled his old idea of\nRobinson Crusoe.\n\n[Sidenote: THE RULING PASSION STILL STRONG.]\n\n\"That rascal Ayrton will have no cause to complain,\" cried he in his\nenthusiasm. \"The island is a paradise!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Harry Grant, \"a paradise for three poor sailors whom\nHeaven sheltered here. But I regret that Maria Theresa is not a large\nand fertile island, with a river instead of a rivulet, and a harbor\ninstead of a coast so exposed to the force of the waves.\"\n\n\"And why, captain?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because I would have laid here the foundation of that colony that I\nwish to present to Scotland.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Glenarvan. \"Then you have not abandoned the idea that has\nmade you so popular in your native land?\"\n\n\"No, my lord; and God has saved me, through your instrumentality, only\nto permit me to accomplish it. Our poor brothers of old Caledonia shall\nyet have another Scotland in the New World. Our dear country must\npossess in these seas a colony of her own, where she can find that\nindependence and prosperity that are wanting in many European empires.\"\n\n\"That is well said, captain,\" replied Lady Helena. \"It is a noble\nproject, and worthy of a great heart. But this island----?\"\n\n\"No, madam, it is a rock, only large enough to support a few colonists;\nwhile we need a vast territory, rich in all primitive treasures.\"\n\n\"Well, captain,\" cried Glenarvan, \"the future is before us! Let us seek\nthis land together!\"\n\nThe hands of both men met in a warm clasp, as if to ratify this\npromise. All now wished to hear the story of the shipwrecked sailors\nof the Britannia during those two long years of solitude. Harry Grant\naccordingly hastened to satisfy the desires of his new friends, and\nbegan as follows:\n\n[Illustration: Harry Grant set his table in the shade, and all took\nseats around it.]\n\n[Sidenote: A TALE OF INDUSTRY.]\n\n\"It was on the night of the 26th of June, 1862, that the Britannia,\ndisabled by a six days' tempest, was wrecked on the rock of Maria\nTheresa. The sea was so high that to save anything was impossible,\nand all the crew perished except my two sailors, Bob Learce and Joe\nBell, and myself; and we succeeded in reaching the coast after many\nstruggles. The land that we thus reached was only a desert island, two\nmiles wide and five long, with a few trees in the interior, some meadow\nland, and a spring of fresh water that, fortunately, has never ceased\nto flow. Alone with my two sailors, in this quarter of the globe, I did\nnot despair, but, placing my confidence in God, engaged in a resolute\nstruggle. Bob and Joe, my companions and friends in misfortune,\nenergetically aided my efforts. We began, like Robinson Crusoe, by\ncollecting the fragments of the vessel, some tools, a little powder,\nseveral weapons, and a bag of precious seeds. The first weeks were very\ntoilsome, but soon hunting and fishing furnished us subsistence, for\nwild goats swarmed in the interior of the island, and marine animals\nabounded on its coast. Gradually our daily routine was regularly\norganized. I determined our exact situation by my instruments, which\nI had saved from the shipwreck. We were out of the regular course of\nships, and could not be rescued except by a providential interposition.\nAlthough thinking of those who were dear to me, and whom I never\nexpected to see again, still I accepted this trial with fortitude, and\nmy most earnest prayers were for my two children. Meantime we labored\nresolutely. Much of the land was sown with the seeds taken from the\nBritannia; and potatoes, chicory, sorrel, and other vegetables improved\nand varied our daily food. We caught several goats, which were easily\nkept, and had milk and butter. The breadfruit-tree, which grew in the\ndry creeks, furnished us with a sort of nourishing bread, and the\nwants of life no longer gave us any alarm. We built a house out of the\nfragments of the Britannia, covered it with sails, carefully tarred,\nand under this shelter the rainy season was comfortably passed. Here\nmany plans were discussed, and many dreams enjoyed, the best of which\nhas just been realized! At first I thought of braving the sea in a\nboat made of the wreck of the vessel; but a vast distance separated us\nfrom the nearest land. No boat could have endured so long a voyage.\nI therefore abandoned my design, and no longer expected deliverance,\nexcept through a Divine interposition. Ah, my poor children, how many\ntimes, on the rocks of the coast, have we waited for ships at sea!\nDuring the entire period of our exile only two or three sails appeared\non the horizon, and these soon to disappear again. Two years and a half\npassed thus. We no longer hoped, but still did not wholly despair. At\nlast, yesterday afternoon, I had mounted the highest summit of the\nisland, when I perceived a faint smoke in the west, which grew clearer,\nand I soon distinctly discerned a vessel that seemed to be coming\ntowards us. But would she not avoid this island, which offered no\nlanding-place? Ah, what a day of anguish, and how my heart throbbed! My\ncompanions kindled a fire on one of the peaks. Night came, but the ship\ngave no signal for approach. Deliverance was there, and should we see\nit vanish? I hesitated no longer. The darkness increased. The vessel\nmight double the island during the night. I threw myself into the sea,\nto swim to her. Hope increased my strength. I beat the waves with\nalmost superhuman energy, and approached the yacht. Scarcely thirty\nyards separated me, when she tacked. Then I uttered those despairing\ncries which my two children alone heard, for they were no illusion. I\nreturned to the shore, exhausted and overcome by fatigue and emotion.\nIt was a terrible night, this last one on the island. We believed\nourselves forever abandoned, when, at daybreak, I perceived the yacht\nslowly coasting along the shores. Your boat was then lowered,--we were\nsaved, and, thanks to the Divine goodness of Heaven, my dear children\nwere there to stretch out their arms to me!\" [Sidenote: THE DOCUMENT\nONCE MORE!]\n\nHarry Grant's story was finished amid a fresh shower of kisses and\ncaresses from Robert and Mary. The captain learned now, for the first\ntime, that he owed his deliverance to that hieroglyphic document\nthat, eight days after his shipwreck, he had inclosed in a bottle and\nconfided to the mercy of the waves.\n\nBut what did Jacques Paganel think during this recital? The worthy\ngeographer revolved the words of the document a thousand ways in his\nbrain. He reviewed his three interpretations, which were all false. How\nhad this island been indicated in these damaged papers? He could no\nlonger restrain himself, but, seizing Harry Grant's hand, cried:\n\n\"Captain, will you tell me what your undecipherable document contained?\"\n\nAt this request curiosity was general, for the long-sought clew to the\nmystery would now be given.\n\n\"Well, captain,\" said Paganel, \"do you remember the exact words of the\ndocument?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" replied Harry Grant; \"and scarcely a day has passed but\nmemory has recalled those words upon which our only hope hung.\"\n\n\"And what are they, captain?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"Tell us, for our\ncuriosity is great.\"\n\n\"I am ready to satisfy you,\" continued Harry Grant; \"but you know that,\nto increase the chances of success, I inclosed in the bottle three\ndocuments, written in three languages. Which one do you wish to hear?\"\n\n\"They are not identical, then?\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, almost to a word.\"\n\n\"Well, give us the French document,\" said Glenarvan. \"This one was\nspared the most by the waves, and has served as the principal basis for\nour search.\"\n\n\"This is it, my lord, word for word,\" answered Harry Grant.\n\n\"'On the 27th June, 1862, the brig Britannia, of Glasgow, was lost\n1500 leagues from Patagonia, in the southern hemisphere. Carried by the\nwaves, two sailors and Captain Grant reached Tabor Island----'\"\n\n\"Ha!\" interrupted Paganel.\n\n\"'Here,'\" resumed Harry Grant, \"'continually a prey to a cruel\ndestitution, they cast this document into the sea at longitude 153\u00b0 and\nlatitude 37\u00b0 11'. Come to their aid, or they are lost.'\"\n\nAt the word \"Tabor,\" Paganel had suddenly risen, and then, controlling\nhimself no longer, he cried:\n\n\"How Tabor Island? It is Maria Theresa.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Harry Grant; \"Maria Theresa on the\nEnglish and German, but Tabor on the French maps.\"\n\nAt this moment a vigorous blow descended upon Paganel's shoulder. Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety.", "At this moment a vigorous blow descended upon Paganel's shoulder. Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety.\n\n\"A fine geographer you are!\" said MacNabb, in a tone of badinage. \"But\nno matter, since we have succeeded.\"\n\n\"No matter?\" cried Paganel; \"I ought never to have forgotten that\ntwofold appellation! It is an unpardonable mistake, unworthy of the\nsecretary of a Geographical Society. I am disgraced!\"\n\nWhen the meal was finished, Harry Grant put everything in order in his\nhouse. He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island. May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words. You will be far removed from every land,\nand deprived of all communication with your fellow-men. Miracles are\nrare, and you will not probably remove from this island, where we leave\nyou. You will be alone, under the eye of God, who reads the uttermost\ndepths of all hearts; but you will not be lost, as was Captain Grant.\nHowever unworthy you may be of the remembrance of men, still they will\nremember you. I know where you are, and will never forget you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord!\" replied Ayrton, simply.\n\nSuch were the last words exchanged between Glenarvan and the\nquartermaster. The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot. The abandoned\nman could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting,\nnot even books, foremost among which was a Bible.\n\nThe hour for separation had come. The crew and passengers stood on\ndeck. More than one felt the heart strangely moved. Lady Helena and\nMary Grant could not repress their emotion.\n\n\"Must it then be so?\" inquired the young wife of her husband. \"Must\nthis unfortunate be abandoned?\"\n\n[Sidenote: \"FAREWELL! A LONG FAREWELL!\"]\n\n\"He must, Helena,\" answered Glenarvan. \"It is his punishment.\"\n\nAt this moment the boat, commanded by Captain Mangles, started. Ayrton\nraised his hat and gave a grave salute. Glenarvan and the crew returned\nthis last farewell, as if to a man about to die, as he departed, in a\nprofound silence.\n\nOn reaching the shore, Ayrton leaped upon the sand, and the boat\nreturned. It was then four o'clock in the afternoon, and from the upper\ndeck the passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded arms,\nstanding motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the vessel.\n\n\"Shall we start, my lord?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes, John,\" replied Glenarvan, quickly, with more emotion than he\nwished to manifest.\n\n\"All right!\" cried the captain to the engineer.\n\nThe steam hissed, the screw beat the waves, and at eight o'clock the\nlast summits of Tabor Island disappeared in the shadows of the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nPAGANEL'S LAST ENTANGLEMENT.\n\n\nEleven days after leaving Tabor Island the Duncan came in sight of the\nAustralian coast, and anchored in Talcahuana Bay. Five months had elapsed\nsince her departure from this port, during which time the travelers\nhad made the circuit of the world on this thirty-seventh parallel.\nTheir efforts had not been in vain, for they had found the shipwrecked\nsurvivors of the Britannia.\n\nThe Duncan, having taken in her necessary stores, skirted the coasts\nof Patagonia, doubled Cape Horn, and steamed across the Atlantic. The\nvoyage was very uneventful. The yacht carried a full complement of\nhappy people; there seemed to be no secrets on board.\n\nA mystery, however, still perplexed MacNabb. Why did Paganel always\nkeep hermetically incased in his clothes, and wear a comforter over\nhis ears? The major longed to know the motive for this singular fancy.\nBut in spite of his questions, hints, and suspicions, Paganel did not\nunbutton his coat.\n\nAt last, fifty-three days after leaving Talcahuana, Captain Mangles\ndescried the lighthouse of Cape Clear. The vessel entered St. George's\nChannel, crossed the Irish Sea, and passed into the Frith of Clyde. At\neleven o'clock they anchored at Dumbarton, and early in the afternoon\nthe travelers reached Malcolm Castle, amidst the hurrahs of their\ntenantry and friends.\n\nThus it was that Harry Grant and his two companions were rescued, and\nthat John Mangles married Mary Grant in the old cathedral of St. Mungo,\nwhere the Rev. Mr. Morton, who nine months before had prayed for the\nrescue of the father, now blessed the union of the daughter with one\nof his deliverers. It was arranged that Robert should be a sailor,\nlike his father and brother-in-law, and that he should continue the\ncontemplated project of the former, under the munificent patronage of\nLord Glenarvan.\n\nBut was Jacques Paganel to die a bachelor? Certainly not; for, after\nhis heroic exploits, the worthy geographer could not escape celebrity.\nHis eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\"\n\n\"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\"\n\n\"I do not dare.\"\n\n\"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\"\n\n\"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply.\n\nAt last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack!\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the major.\n\n\"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel.\n\n\"What matter, my worthy friend?\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom\nArabella has dreamed.\"\n\nAnd the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey\nto the most acute anxiety.\n\nA short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle.\n\n[Illustration: Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great\npomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle.]\n\nThe geographer's secret would doubtless have remained forever\nburied in the abysses of the unknown if the major had not told it to\nGlenarvan, who did not conceal it from Lady Helena, who communicated\nit to Mrs. Mangles. In short, it reached the ear of Mrs. Olbinett, and\nspread.\n\nJacques Paganel, during his three days' captivity among the Maoris, had\nbeen tattooed from head to foot, and bore on his breast the picture of\nan heraldic kiwi with outstretched wings, in the act of biting at his\nheart.\n\nThis was the only adventure of his great voyage for which Paganel\ncould never be consoled or pardon the New Zealanders. In spite of the\nrepresentations of his friends, he dared not go back to France, for\nfear of exposing the whole Geographical Society in his person to the\njests and railleries of the caricaturists.\n\nThe return of Captain Grant to Scotland was welcomed as a cause for\nnational rejoicing, and he became the popular man of old Caledonia. His\nson Robert has become a sailor like himself, and, under the patronage\nof Lord Glenarvan, has undertaken the plan of founding a Scottish\ncolony on the shores washed by the Pacific Ocean.\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 46597 ***"]
